5月2日，美国《纽约时报》周四发文称，尽管受到了美国政府的施压，苹果公司依旧高度依赖中国。没有中国供应商的支持，苹果的市值恐将缩水一半甚至更多。 苹果北京零售店 早在特朗普涉足政坛之前，苹果及其合作伙伴就在中国各地建起了大型工厂，以组装iPhone。特朗普在首次竞选总统时曾向支持者承诺，他将迫使苹果把这些产品带回美国生产。 然而近十年过去了，情况几乎没有什么改变。苹果并未将制造业带回本土，而是将部分生产从中国转移到了印度、越南和泰国。苹果在美国制造的产品几乎可以忽略不计，估计仍有大约80%的iPhone是在中国生产的。 离不开中国 苹果在中国的根基十分深厚。几十年前，该公司便在中国建立了制造业务，而且不需要与中国企业成立合资公司。随后，苹果在中国完善了低成本组装设备的工艺，并将产品销售给不断壮大的中国中产阶层。苹果深耕中国为其带来了全球超过80%的智能手机利润，以及每年670亿美元的中国市场销售额。 随着时间的推移，苹果与中国的联系愈发紧密。如今，苹果不仅在中国组装大多数iPhone，其中国供应商还负责为印度制造的设备供应零件，并在越南生产组件和AirPods。 尽管这些年来受到了种种压力，但苹果的业务依旧高度依赖中国，以至于没有中国它根本无法运营。特朗普政府试图改变苹果行为的举措，可能会对这家全球市值最高的上市公司造成损害。即便苹果生产迁回至美国在技术上可行，也需要该公司与美国联邦政府共同付出巨大努力。 iPhone 上个月，在特朗普宣布对中国出口商品征收高额关税后的四天内，苹果市值蒸发了7700亿美元。此后，特朗普为中国生产的消费电子品提供了暂时豁免，这才让苹果收复了部分股价损失。 周四，苹果CEO蒂姆·库克(Tim Cook)在财报电话会议上首次回应了关税对公司业绩的影响。他表示，美国关税将导致该公司本季度成本增加9亿美元。 市值腰斩 深水资产管理公司合伙人吉恩·蒙斯特(Gene Munster)预计，最坏情况下，苹果公司的市值会因脱离中国缩水一半甚至更多。这意味着，苹果将从目前的3.2万亿美元跌至1.6万亿美元，原因在于其大约三分之一的销售额依赖于在中国制造的产品，即使苹果将部分生产转移到其他国家也无济于事。 如果再加上失去的中国客户，苹果的市值可能会进一步下滑至1.2万亿美元。 苹果市值的大幅下跌将在整个股市产生连锁反应。该公司在标普500指数中的市值权重约为6%。这意味着，投资者在追踪标普500指数的基金中每投入1美元，就有约6美分投向了苹果股票。投资者以及大多数401(k)退休账户持有人，将看到这部分投资缩水一半。 美施压适得其反 但是在特朗普眼中，苹果对中国的依赖就是制造业岗位的流失。特朗普政府希望将更多电子制造业带回美国。作为全球最有影响力的电子企业，苹果比任何同行都有更大能力实现这一目标。它生产的智能手机数量和其他公司都多，在组件上的支出也超过了竞争对手，因此它能左右供应商的运营所在地。 特朗普政府希望苹果启动制造业回流美国的进程。美国商务部长霍华德·卢特尼克(Howard Lutnick)在今年4月的一次电视采访中表示：“数以百万计的人用螺丝刀拧小螺丝来组装iPhone，这种事情将会来到美国。” 特朗普希望苹果在美国制造 然而，施压苹果离开中国可能会适得其反。新的关税可能迫使苹果提高iPhone售价，或者接受更低的智能手机利润。相比之下，三星的手机是在越南生产的，不受中国关税影响，价格可能更具优势。苹果在本土的竞争力可能因此减弱，这是特朗普通常不愿逾越的红线。 据两位熟悉相关分析情况的匿名知情人士透露，苹果一直不愿在美国生产 iPhone和其他设备，因为该公司的运营团队认为这是不可能实现的。十年前，苹果曾尝试在美国得州组装Mac电脑，结果因螺丝采购困难和难以找到熟练工人而遭受挫折。 而在中国，苹果的供应商可以召集到20万名工人。他们在拥有多年制造经验的数千名工程师监督下工作。大多数工人住在靠近iPhone工厂的宿舍里，显示屏等组件沿着比足球场还长的装配线传送。 市场研究公司TechInsights分析师韦恩·林(Wayne Lam)表示，在美国大多数城市里，苹果根本不可能找到这么多工人和经验丰富的工程师。他指出，苹果如果要在美国生产，将需要开发更多自动化流程，利用机器人来弥补美国人口规模的不足。 根据韦恩·林到估算，如果苹果真的在美国建立生产业务，要想维持当前的利润水平，公司可能需要将一部iPhone的售价提高到2000美元，较现在的大约1000美元翻了一番。随着苹果削减工人培训和组件制造成本，iPhone售价可能会在未来降到1500美元。 “从短期来看，这在经济上是不可行的。”韦恩·林表示。他还指出，把一款已经问世接近20年、随时可能被新兴消费电子产品取代的设备生产迁回美国，意义大不大。 政府刺激 苹果已经展现出在有政府激励的情况下调整其供应链的意愿。2017年，由于印度对进口商品征收高额税收，导致iPhone价格可能会升高到一个苹果无法在世界上增长最快的智能手机市场中占有一席之地的程度，苹果启动了在印度制造iPhone的进程。 目前，印度约占iPhone全球产能的大约20%。苹果也在印度生产一些组件，包括金属框架，但仍依赖中国公司组装显示屏和其他复杂零件。 马修·摩尔(Matthew Moore)曾在苹果担任制造设计经理长达九年之久。他表示，印度还有一个美国所不具备的优势：“到处都是的工程师。” 摩尔认为，要想吸引苹果和其他电子企业来到美国，特朗普政府需要在科学、技术、工程和数学领域的学位教育方面加大投入。他还表示，美国应当像对住房贷款那样，为新的制造设施提供贷款支持，就像通过房利美和房地美为住房贷款提供支持那样。 上个月，苹果赢得了一丝喘息之机。苹果CEO库克游说特朗普政府，使得苹果手机及其他电子产品获得了关税豁免。不过这只是暂时的，因为美国政府表示计划针对科技产品出台更具针对性的关税措施。 摩尔表示，如果没有政府的投资，苹果以及规模较小的制造商仍会继续在中国生产产品，因为中国拥有充足设备和工程师。摩尔创办了Cruz公司，该公司制造像搅拌机这样的硬件产品。 “我不认为美国已错失机会，但那种认为在四年之内我们就能在本土生产iPhone的想法实在是荒谬之极。这需要十年的时间。”摩尔称。 0 对文章打分 纽约时报：苹果不能没有中国 0 (0%) 1 (100%) 已有 0 条意见 登录 还可以输入320字 [刷新验证码] 最新资讯 02:57 苹果与 Anthropic 合作推出基于 Claude 的 AI 编程平台 据彭博社报道，苹果公司正在与

上个月，苹果赢得了一丝喘息之机。苹果CEO库克游说特朗普政府，使得苹果手机及其他电子产品获得了关税豁免。不过这只是暂时的，因为美国政府表示计划针对科技产品出台更具针对性的关税措施。 摩尔表示，如果没有政府的投资，苹果以及规模较小的制造商仍会继续在中国生产产品，因为中国拥有充足设备和工程师。摩尔创办了Cruz公司，该公司制造像搅拌机这样的硬件产品。 “我不认为美国已错失机会，但那种认为在四年之内我们就能在本土生产iPhone的想法实在是荒谬之极。这需要十年的时间。”摩尔称。 0 对文章打分 纽约时报：苹果不能没有中国 0 (0%) 1 (100%) 已有 0 条意见 登录 还可以输入320字 [刷新验证码] 最新资讯 02:57 苹果与 Anthropic 合作推出基于 Claude 的 AI 编程平台 据彭博社报道，苹果公司正在与

5月2日，美国《纽约时报》周四发文称，尽管受到了美国政府的施压，苹果公司依旧高度依赖中国。没有中国供应商的支持，苹果的市值恐将缩水一半甚至更多。 苹果北京零售店 早在特朗普涉足政坛之前，苹果及其合作伙伴就在中国各地建起了大型工厂，以组装iPhone。特朗普在首次竞选总统时曾向支持者承诺，他将迫使苹果把这些产品带回美国生产。 然而近十年过去了，情况几乎没有什么改变。苹果并未将制造业带回本土，而是将部分生产从中国转移到了印度、越南和泰国。苹果在美国制造的产品几乎可以忽略不计，估计仍有大约80%的iPhone是在中国生产的。 离不开中国 苹果在中国的根基十分深厚。几十年前，该公司便在中国建立了制造业务，而且不需要与中国企业成立合资公司。随后，苹果在中国完善了低成本组装设备的工艺，并将产品销售给不断壮大的中国中产阶层。苹果深耕中国为其带来了全球超过80%的智能手机利润，以及每年670亿美元的中国市场销售额。 随着时间的推移，苹果与中国的联系愈发紧密。如今，苹果不仅在中国组装大多数iPhone，其中国供应商还负责为印度制造的设备供应零件，并在越南生产组件和AirPods。 尽管这些年来受到了种种压力，但苹果的业务依旧高度依赖中国，以至于没有中国它根本无法运营。特朗普政府试图改变苹果行为的举措，可能会对这家全球市值最高的上市公司造成损害。即便苹果生产迁回至美国在技术上可行，也需要该公司与美国联邦政府共同付出巨大努力。 iPhone 上个月，在特朗普宣布对中国出口商品征收高额关税后的四天内，苹果市值蒸发了7700亿美元。此后，特朗普为中国生产的消费电子品提供了暂时豁免，这才让苹果收复了部分股价损失。 周四，苹果CEO蒂姆·库克(Tim Cook)在财报电话会议上首次回应了关税对公司业绩的影响。他表示，美国关税将导致该公司本季度成本增加9亿美元。 市值腰斩 深水资产管理公司合伙人吉恩·蒙斯特(Gene Munster)预计，最坏情况下，苹果公司的市值会因脱离中国缩水一半甚至更多。这意味着，苹果将从目前的3.2万亿美元跌至1.6万亿美元，原因在于其大约三分之一的销售额依赖于在中国制造的产品，即使苹果将部分生产转移到其他国家也无济于事。 如果再加上失去的中国客户，苹果的市值可能会进一步下滑至1.2万亿美元。 苹果市值的大幅下跌将在整个股市产生连锁反应。该公司在标普500指数中的市值权重约为6%。这意味着，投资者在追踪标普500指数的基金中每投入1美元，就有约6美分投向了苹果股票。投资者以及大多数401(k)退休账户持有人，将看到这部分投资缩水一半。 美施压适得其反 但是在特朗普眼中，苹果对中国的依赖就是制造业岗位的流失。特朗普政府希望将更多电子制造业带回美国。作为全球最有影响力的电子企业，苹果比任何同行都有更大能力实现这一目标。它生产的智能手机数量和其他公司都多，在组件上的支出也超过了竞争对手，因此它能左右供应商的运营所在地。 特朗普政府希望苹果启动制造业回流美国的进程。美国商务部长霍华德·卢特尼克(Howard Lutnick)在今年4月的一次电视采访中表示：“数以百万计的人用螺丝刀拧小螺丝来组装iPhone，这种事情将会来到美国。” 特朗普希望苹果在美国制造 然而，施压苹果离开中国可能会适得其反。新的关税可能迫使苹果提高iPhone售价，或者接受更低的智能手机利润。相比之下，三星的手机是在越南生产的，不受中国关税影响，价格可能更具优势。苹果在本土的竞争力可能因此减弱，这是特朗普通常不愿逾越的红线。 据两位熟悉相关分析情况的匿名知情人士透露，苹果一直不愿在美国生产 iPhone和其他设备，因为该公司的运营团队认为这是不可能实现的。十年前，苹果曾尝试在美国得州组装Mac电脑，结果因螺丝采购困难和难以找到熟练工人而遭受挫折。 而在中国，苹果的供应商可以召集到20万名工人。他们在拥有多年制造经验的数千名工程师监督下工作。大多数工人住在靠近iPhone工厂的宿舍里，显示屏等组件沿着比足球场还长的装配线传送。 市场研究公司TechInsights分析师韦恩·林(Wayne Lam)表示，在美国大多数城市里，苹果根本不可能找到这么多工人和经验丰富的工程师。他指出，苹果如果要在美国生产，将需要开发更多自动化流程，利用机器人来弥补美国人口规模的不足。 根据韦恩·林到估算，如果苹果真的在美国建立生产业务，要想维持当前的利润水平，公司可能需要将一部iPhone的售价提高到2000美元，较现在的大约1000美元翻了一番。随着苹果削减工人培训和组件制造成本，iPhone售价可能会在未来降到1500美元。 “从短期来看，这在经济上是不可行的。”韦恩·林表示。他还指出，把一款已经问世接近20年、随时可能被新兴消费电子产品取代的设备生产迁回美国，意义大不大。 政府刺激 苹果已经展现出在有政府激励的情况下调整其供应链的意愿。2017年，由于印度对进口商品征收高额税收，导致iPhone价格可能会升高到一个苹果无法在世界上增长最快的智能手机市场中占有一席之地的程度，苹果启动了在印度制造iPhone的进程。 目前，印度约占iPhone全球产能的大约20%。苹果也在印度生产一些组件，包括金属框架，但仍依赖中国公司组装显示屏和其他复杂零件。

5月2日，美国《纽约时报》周四发文称，尽管受到了美国政府的施压，苹果公司依旧高度依赖中国。没有中国供应商的支持，苹果的市值恐将缩水一半甚至更多。 苹果北京零售店 早在特朗普涉足政坛之前，苹果及其合作伙伴就在中国各地建起了大型工厂，以组装iPhone。特朗普在首次竞选总统时曾向支持者承诺，他将迫使苹果把这些产品带回美国生产。 然而近十年过去了，情况几乎没有什么改变。苹果并未将制造业带回本土，而是将部分生产从中国转移到了印度、越南和泰国。苹果在美国制造的产品几乎可以忽略不计，估计仍有大约80%的iPhone是在中国生产的。 离不开中国 苹果在中国的根基十分深厚。几十年前，该公司便在中国建立了制造业务，而且不需要与中国企业成立合资公司。随后，苹果在中国完善了低成本组装设备的工艺，并将产品销售给不断壮大的中国中产阶层。苹果深耕中国为其带来了全球超过80%的智能手机利润，以及每年670亿美元的中国市场销售额。 随着时间的推移，苹果与中国的联系愈发紧密。如今，苹果不仅在中国组装大多数iPhone，其中国供应商还负责为印度制造的设备供应零件，并在越南生产组件和AirPods。 尽管这些年来受到了种种压力，但苹果的业务依旧高度依赖中国，以至于没有中国它根本无法运营。特朗普政府试图改变苹果行为的举措，可能会对这家全球市值最高的上市公司造成损害。即便苹果生产迁回至美国在技术上可行，也需要该公司与美国联邦政府共同付出巨大努力。 iPhone 上个月，在特朗普宣布对中国出口商品征收高额关税后的四天内，苹果市值蒸发了7700亿美元。此后，特朗普为中国生产的消费电子品提供了暂时豁免，这才让苹果收复了部分股价损失。 周四，苹果CEO蒂姆·库克(Tim Cook)在财报电话会议上首次回应了关税对公司业绩的影响。他表示，美国关税将导致该公司本季度成本增加9亿美元。 市值腰斩 深水资产管理公司合伙人吉恩·蒙斯特(Gene Munster)预计，最坏情况下，苹果公司的市值会因脱离中国缩水一半甚至更多。这意味着，苹果将从目前的3.2万亿美元跌至1.6万亿美元，原因在于其大约三分之一的销售额依赖于在中国制造的产品，即使苹果将部分生产转移到其他国家也无济于事。 如果再加上失去的中国客户，苹果的市值可能会进一步下滑至1.2万亿美元。 苹果市值的大幅下跌将在整个股市产生连锁反应。该公司在标普500指数中的市值权重约为6%。这意味着，投资者在追踪标普500指数的基金中每投入1美元，就有约6美分投向了苹果股票。投资者以及大多数401(k)退休账户持有人，将看到这部分投资缩水一半。 美施压适得其反 但是在特朗普眼中，苹果对中国的依赖就是制造业岗位的流失。特朗普政府希望将更多电子制造业带回美国。作为全球最有影响力的电子企业，苹果比任何同行都有更大能力实现这一目标。它生产的智能手机数量和其他公司都多，在组件上的支出也超过了竞争对手，因此它能左右供应商的运营所在地。 特朗普政府希望苹果启动制造业回流美国的进程。美国商务部长霍华德·卢特尼克(Howard Lutnick)在今年4月的一次电视采访中表示：“数以百万计的人用螺丝刀拧小螺丝来组装iPhone，这种事情将会来到美国。” 特朗普希望苹果在美国制造 然而，施压苹果离开中国可能会适得其反。新的关税可能迫使苹果提高iPhone售价，或者接受更低的智能手机利润。相比之下，三星的手机是在越南生产的，不受中国关税影响，价格可能更具优势。苹果在本土的竞争力可能因此减弱，这是特朗普通常不愿逾越的红线。 据两位熟悉相关分析情况的匿名知情人士透露，苹果一直不愿在美国生产 iPhone和其他设备，因为该公司的运营团队认为这是不可能实现的。十年前，苹果曾尝试在美国得州组装Mac电脑，结果因螺丝采购困难和难以找到熟练工人而遭受挫折。 而在中国，苹果的供应商可以召集到20万名工人。他们在拥有多年制造经验的数千名工程师监督下工作。大多数工人住在靠近iPhone工厂的宿舍里，显示屏等组件沿着比足球场还长的装配线传送。 市场研究公司TechInsights分析师韦恩·林(Wayne Lam)表示，在美国大多数城市里，苹果根本不可能找到这么多工人和经验丰富的工程师。他指出，苹果如果要在美国生产，将需要开发更多自动化流程，利用机器人来弥补美国人口规模的不足。 根据韦恩·林到估算，如果苹果真的在美国建立生产业务，要想维持当前的利润水平，公司可能需要将一部iPhone的售价提高到2000美元，较现在的大约1000美元翻了一番。随着苹果削减工人培训和组件制造成本，iPhone售价可能会在未来降到1500美元。 “从短期来看，这在经济上是不可行的。”韦恩·林表示。他还指出，把一款已经问世接近20年、随时可能被新兴消费电子产品取代的设备生产迁回美国，意义大不大。 政府刺激 苹果已经展现出在有政府激励的情况下调整其供应链的意愿。2017年，由于印度对进口商品征收高额税收，导致iPhone价格可能会升高到一个苹果无法在世界上增长最快的智能手机市场中占有一席之地的程度，苹果启动了在印度制造iPhone的进程。 目前，印度约占iPhone全球产能的大约20%。苹果也在印度生产一些组件，包括金属框架，但仍依赖中国公司组装显示屏和其他复杂零件。 马修·摩尔(Matthew Moore)曾在苹果担任制造设计经理长达九年之久。他表示，印度还有一个美国所不具备的优势：“到处都是的工程师。” 摩尔认为，要想吸引苹果和其他电子企业来到美国，特朗普政府需要在科学、技术、工程和数学领域的学位教育方面加大投入。他还表示，美国应当像对住房贷款那样，为新的制造设施提供贷款支持，就像通过房利美和房地美为住房贷款提供支持那样。 上个月，苹果赢得了一丝喘息之机。苹果CEO库克游说特朗普政府，使得苹果手机及其他电子产品获得了关税豁免。不过这只是暂时的，因为美国政府表示计划针对科技产品出台更具针对性的关税措施。 摩尔表示，如果没有政府的投资，苹果以及规模较小的制造商仍会继续在中国生产产品，因为中国拥有充足设备和工程师。摩尔创办了Cruz公司，该公司制造像搅拌机这样的硬件产品。 “我不认为美国已错失机会，但那种认为在四年之内我们就能在本土生产iPhone的想法实在是荒谬之极。这需要十年的时间。”摩尔称。 0 对文章打分 纽约时报：苹果不能没有中国 0 (0%) 1 (100%) 已有 0 条意见 登录 还可以输入320字 [刷新验证码] 最新资讯 02:57 苹果与 Anthropic 合作推出基于 Claude 的 AI 编程平台 据彭博社报道，苹果公司正在与

根据韦恩·林到估算，如果苹果真的在美国建立生产业务，要想维持当前的利润水平，公司可能需要将一部iPhone的售价提高到2000美元，较现在的大约1000美元翻了一番。随着苹果削减工人培训和组件制造成本，iPhone售价可能会在未来降到1500美元。 “从短期来看，这在经济上是不可行的。”韦恩·林表示。他还指出，把一款已经问世接近20年、随时可能被新兴消费电子产品取代的设备生产迁回美国，意义大不大。 政府刺激 苹果已经展现出在有政府激励的情况下调整其供应链的意愿。2017年，由于印度对进口商品征收高额税收，导致iPhone价格可能会升高到一个苹果无法在世界上增长最快的智能手机市场中占有一席之地的程度，苹果启动了在印度制造iPhone的进程。 目前，印度约占iPhone全球产能的大约20%。苹果也在印度生产一些组件，包括金属框架，但仍依赖中国公司组装显示屏和其他复杂零件。 马修·摩尔(Matthew Moore)曾在苹果担任制造设计经理长达九年之久。他表示，印度还有一个美国所不具备的优势：“到处都是的工程师。” 摩尔认为，要想吸引苹果和其他电子企业来到美国，特朗普政府需要在科学、技术、工程和数学领域的学位教育方面加大投入。他还表示，美国应当像对住房贷款那样，为新的制造设施提供贷款支持，就像通过房利美和房地美为住房贷款提供支持那样。 上个月，苹果赢得了一丝喘息之机。苹果CEO库克游说特朗普政府，使得苹果手机及其他电子产品获得了关税豁免。不过这只是暂时的，因为美国政府表示计划针对科技产品出台更具针对性的关税措施。 摩尔表示，如果没有政府的投资，苹果以及规模较小的制造商仍会继续在中国生产产品，因为中国拥有充足设备和工程师。摩尔创办了Cruz公司，该公司制造像搅拌机这样的硬件产品。 “我不认为美国已错失机会，但那种认为在四年之内我们就能在本土生产iPhone的想法实在是荒谬之极。这需要十年的时间。”摩尔称。 0 对文章打分 纽约时报：苹果不能没有中国 0 (0%) 1 (100%) 已有 0 条意见 登录 还可以输入320字 [刷新验证码] 最新资讯 02:57 苹果与 Anthropic 合作推出基于 Claude 的 AI 编程平台 据彭博社报道，苹果公司正在与

5月2日，美国《纽约时报》周四发文称，尽管受到了美国政府的施压，苹果公司依旧高度依赖中国。没有中国供应商的支持，苹果的市值恐将缩水一半甚至更多。 苹果北京零售店 早在特朗普涉足政坛之前，苹果及其合作伙伴就在中国各地建起了大型工厂，以组装iPhone。特朗普在首次竞选总统时曾向支持者承诺，他将迫使苹果把这些产品带回美国生产。 然而近十年过去了，情况几乎没有什么改变。苹果并未将制造业带回本土，而是将部分生产从中国转移到了印度、越南和泰国。苹果在美国制造的产品几乎可以忽略不计，估计仍有大约80%的iPhone是在中国生产的。 离不开中国 苹果在中国的根基十分深厚。几十年前，该公司便在中国建立了制造业务，而且不需要与中国企业成立合资公司。随后，苹果在中国完善了低成本组装设备的工艺，并将产品销售给不断壮大的中国中产阶层。苹果深耕中国为其带来了全球超过80%的智能手机利润，以及每年670亿美元的中国市场销售额。 随着时间的推移，苹果与中国的联系愈发紧密。如今，苹果不仅在中国组装大多数iPhone，其中国供应商还负责为印度制造的设备供应零件，并在越南生产组件和AirPods。 尽管这些年来受到了种种压力，但苹果的业务依旧高度依赖中国，以至于没有中国它根本无法运营。特朗普政府试图改变苹果行为的举措，可能会对这家全球市值最高的上市公司造成损害。即便苹果生产迁回至美国在技术上可行，也需要该公司与美国联邦政府共同付出巨大努力。 iPhone 上个月，在特朗普宣布对中国出口商品征收高额关税后的四天内，苹果市值蒸发了7700亿美元。此后，特朗普为中国生产的消费电子品提供了暂时豁免，这才让苹果收复了部分股价损失。 周四，苹果CEO蒂姆·库克(Tim Cook)在财报电话会议上首次回应了关税对公司业绩的影响。他表示，美国关税将导致该公司本季度成本增加9亿美元。 市值腰斩 深水资产管理公司合伙人吉恩·蒙斯特(Gene Munster)预计，最坏情况下，苹果公司的市值会因脱离中国缩水一半甚至更多。这意味着，苹果将从目前的3.2万亿美元跌至1.6万亿美元，原因在于其大约三分之一的销售额依赖于在中国制造的产品，即使苹果将部分生产转移到其他国家也无济于事。 如果再加上失去的中国客户，苹果的市值可能会进一步下滑至1.2万亿美元。 苹果市值的大幅下跌将在整个股市产生连锁反应。该公司在标普500指数中的市值权重约为6%。这意味着，投资者在追踪标普500指数的基金中每投入1美元，就有约6美分投向了苹果股票。投资者以及大多数401(k)退休账户持有人，将看到这部分投资缩水一半。 美施压适得其反 但是在特朗普眼中，苹果对中国的依赖就是制造业岗位的流失。特朗普政府希望将更多电子制造业带回美国。作为全球最有影响力的电子企业，苹果比任何同行都有更大能力实现这一目标。它生产的智能手机数量和其他公司都多，在组件上的支出也超过了竞争对手，因此它能左右供应商的运营所在地。 特朗普政府希望苹果启动制造业回流美国的进程。美国商务部长霍华德·卢特尼克(Howard Lutnick)在今年4月的一次电视采访中表示：“数以百万计的人用螺丝刀拧小螺丝来组装iPhone，这种事情将会来到美国。” 特朗普希望苹果在美国制造 然而，施压苹果离开中国可能会适得其反。新的关税可能迫使苹果提高iPhone售价，或者接受更低的智能手机利润。相比之下，三星的手机是在越南生产的，不受中国关税影响，价格可能更具优势。苹果在本土的竞争力可能因此减弱，这是特朗普通常不愿逾越的红线。 据两位熟悉相关分析情况的匿名知情人士透露，苹果一直不愿在美国生产 iPhone和其他设备，因为该公司的运营团队认为这是不可能实现的。十年前，苹果曾尝试在美国得州组装Mac电脑，结果因螺丝采购困难和难以找到熟练工人而遭受挫折。 而在中国，苹果的供应商可以召集到20万名工人。他们在拥有多年制造经验的数千名工程师监督下工作。大多数工人住在靠近iPhone工厂的宿舍里，显示屏等组件沿着比足球场还长的装配线传送。 市场研究公司TechInsights分析师韦恩·林(Wayne Lam)表示，在美国大多数城市里，苹果根本不可能找到这么多工人和经验丰富的工程师。他指出，苹果如果要在美国生产，将需要开发更多自动化流程，利用机器人来弥补美国人口规模的不足。 根据韦恩·林到估算，如果苹果真的在美国建立生产业务，要想维持当前的利润水平，公司可能需要将一部iPhone的售价提高到2000美元，较现在的大约1000美元翻了一番。随着苹果削减工人培训和组件制造成本，iPhone售价可能会在未来降到1500美元。 “从短期来看，这在经济上是不可行的。”韦恩·林表示。他还指出，把一款已经问世接近20年、随时可能被新兴消费电子产品取代的设备生产迁回美国，意义大不大。 政府刺激 苹果已经展现出在有政府激励的情况下调整其供应链的意愿。2017年，由于印度对进口商品征收高额税收，导致iPhone价格可能会升高到一个苹果无法在世界上增长最快的智能手机市场中占有一席之地的程度，苹果启动了在印度制造iPhone的进程。 目前，印度约占iPhone全球产能的大约20%。苹果也在印度生产一些组件，包括金属框架，但仍依赖中国公司组装显示屏和其他复杂零件。 马修·摩尔(Matthew Moore)曾在苹果担任制造设计经理长达九年之久。他表示，印度还有一个美国所不具备的优势：“到处都是的工程师。” 摩尔认为，要想吸引苹果和其他电子企业来到美国，特朗普政府需要在科学、技术、工程和数学领域的学位教育方面加大投入。他还表示，美国应当像对住房贷款那样，为新的制造设施提供贷款支持，就像通过房利美和房地美为住房贷款提供支持那样。

5月2日，美国《纽约时报》周四发文称，尽管受到了美国政府的施压，苹果公司依旧高度依赖中国。没有中国供应商的支持，苹果的市值恐将缩水一半甚至更多。 苹果北京零售店 早在特朗普涉足政坛之前，苹果及其合作伙伴就在中国各地建起了大型工厂，以组装iPhone。特朗普在首次竞选总统时曾向支持者承诺，他将迫使苹果把这些产品带回美国生产。 然而近十年过去了，情况几乎没有什么改变。苹果并未将制造业带回本土，而是将部分生产从中国转移到了印度、越南和泰国。苹果在美国制造的产品几乎可以忽略不计，估计仍有大约80%的iPhone是在中国生产的。 离不开中国 苹果在中国的根基十分深厚。几十年前，该公司便在中国建立了制造业务，而且不需要与中国企业成立合资公司。随后，苹果在中国完善了低成本组装设备的工艺，并将产品销售给不断壮大的中国中产阶层。苹果深耕中国为其带来了全球超过80%的智能手机利润，以及每年670亿美元的中国市场销售额。 随着时间的推移，苹果与中国的联系愈发紧密。如今，苹果不仅在中国组装大多数iPhone，其中国供应商还负责为印度制造的设备供应零件，并在越南生产组件和AirPods。 尽管这些年来受到了种种压力，但苹果的业务依旧高度依赖中国，以至于没有中国它根本无法运营。特朗普政府试图改变苹果行为的举措，可能会对这家全球市值最高的上市公司造成损害。即便苹果生产迁回至美国在技术上可行，也需要该公司与美国联邦政府共同付出巨大努力。 iPhone 上个月，在特朗普宣布对中国出口商品征收高额关税后的四天内，苹果市值蒸发了7700亿美元。此后，特朗普为中国生产的消费电子品提供了暂时豁免，这才让苹果收复了部分股价损失。 周四，苹果CEO蒂姆·库克(Tim Cook)在财报电话会议上首次回应了关税对公司业绩的影响。他表示，美国关税将导致该公司本季度成本增加9亿美元。 市值腰斩 深水资产管理公司合伙人吉恩·蒙斯特(Gene Munster)预计，最坏情况下，苹果公司的市值会因脱离中国缩水一半甚至更多。这意味着，苹果将从目前的3.2万亿美元跌至1.6万亿美元，原因在于其大约三分之一的销售额依赖于在中国制造的产品，即使苹果将部分生产转移到其他国家也无济于事。 如果再加上失去的中国客户，苹果的市值可能会进一步下滑至1.2万亿美元。 苹果市值的大幅下跌将在整个股市产生连锁反应。该公司在标普500指数中的市值权重约为6%。这意味着，投资者在追踪标普500指数的基金中每投入1美元，就有约6美分投向了苹果股票。投资者以及大多数401(k)退休账户持有人，将看到这部分投资缩水一半。 美施压适得其反 但是在特朗普眼中，苹果对中国的依赖就是制造业岗位的流失。特朗普政府希望将更多电子制造业带回美国。作为全球最有影响力的电子企业，苹果比任何同行都有更大能力实现这一目标。它生产的智能手机数量和其他公司都多，在组件上的支出也超过了竞争对手，因此它能左右供应商的运营所在地。 特朗普政府希望苹果启动制造业回流美国的进程。美国商务部长霍华德·卢特尼克(Howard Lutnick)在今年4月的一次电视采访中表示：“数以百万计的人用螺丝刀拧小螺丝来组装iPhone，这种事情将会来到美国。” 特朗普希望苹果在美国制造 然而，施压苹果离开中国可能会适得其反。新的关税可能迫使苹果提高iPhone售价，或者接受更低的智能手机利润。相比之下，三星的手机是在越南生产的，不受中国关税影响，价格可能更具优势。苹果在本土的竞争力可能因此减弱，这是特朗普通常不愿逾越的红线。 据两位熟悉相关分析情况的匿名知情人士透露，苹果一直不愿在美国生产 iPhone和其他设备，因为该公司的运营团队认为这是不可能实现的。十年前，苹果曾尝试在美国得州组装Mac电脑，结果因螺丝采购困难和难以找到熟练工人而遭受挫折。 而在中国，苹果的供应商可以召集到20万名工人。他们在拥有多年制造经验的数千名工程师监督下工作。大多数工人住在靠近iPhone工厂的宿舍里，显示屏等组件沿着比足球场还长的装配线传送。 市场研究公司TechInsights分析师韦恩·林(Wayne Lam)表示，在美国大多数城市里，苹果根本不可能找到这么多工人和经验丰富的工程师。他指出，苹果如果要在美国生产，将需要开发更多自动化流程，利用机器人来弥补美国人口规模的不足。 根据韦恩·林到估算，如果苹果真的在美国建立生产业务，要想维持当前的利润水平，公司可能需要将一部iPhone的售价提高到2000美元，较现在的大约1000美元翻了一番。随着苹果削减工人培训和组件制造成本，iPhone售价可能会在未来降到1500美元。 “从短期来看，这在经济上是不可行的。”韦恩·林表示。他还指出，把一款已经问世接近20年、随时可能被新兴消费电子产品取代的设备生产迁回美国，意义大不大。 政府刺激 苹果已经展现出在有政府激励的情况下调整其供应链的意愿。2017年，由于印度对进口商品征收高额税收，导致iPhone价格可能会升高到一个苹果无法在世界上增长最快的智能手机市场中占有一席之地的程度，苹果启动了在印度制造iPhone的进程。 目前，印度约占iPhone全球产能的大约20%。苹果也在印度生产一些组件，包括金属框架，但仍依赖中国公司组装显示屏和其他复杂零件。 马修·摩尔(Matthew Moore)曾在苹果担任制造设计经理长达九年之久。他表示，印度还有一个美国所不具备的优势：“到处都是的工程师。” 摩尔认为，要想吸引苹果和其他电子企业来到美国，特朗普政府需要在科学、技术、工程和数学领域的学位教育方面加大投入。他还表示，美国应当像对住房贷款那样，为新的制造设施提供贷款支持，就像通过房利美和房地美为住房贷款提供支持那样。 上个月，苹果赢得了一丝喘息之机。苹果CEO库克游说特朗普政府，使得苹果手机及其他电子产品获得了关税豁免。不过这只是暂时的，因为美国政府表示计划针对科技产品出台更具针对性的关税措施。 摩尔表示，如果没有政府的投资，苹果以及规模较小的制造商仍会继续在中国生产产品，因为中国拥有充足设备和工程师。摩尔创办了Cruz公司，该公司制造像搅拌机这样的硬件产品。 “我不认为美国已错失机会，但那种认为在四年之内我们就能在本土生产iPhone的想法实在是荒谬之极。这需要十年的时间。”摩尔称。 0 对文章打分 纽约时报：苹果不能没有中国 0 (0%) 1 (100%) 已有 0 条意见 登录 还可以输入320字 [刷新验证码] 最新资讯 02:57 苹果与 Anthropic 合作推出基于 Claude 的 AI 编程平台 据彭博社报道，苹果公司正在与

Lam)表示，在美国大多数城市里，苹果根本不可能找到这么多工人和经验丰富的工程师。他指出，苹果如果要在美国生产，将需要开发更多自动化流程，利用机器人来弥补美国人口规模的不足。 根据韦恩·林到估算，如果苹果真的在美国建立生产业务，要想维持当前的利润水平，公司可能需要将一部iPhone的售价提高到2000美元，较现在的大约1000美元翻了一番。随着苹果削减工人培训和组件制造成本，iPhone售价可能会在未来降到1500美元。 “从短期来看，这在经济上是不可行的。”韦恩·林表示。他还指出，把一款已经问世接近20年、随时可能被新兴消费电子产品取代的设备生产迁回美国，意义大不大。 政府刺激 苹果已经展现出在有政府激励的情况下调整其供应链的意愿。2017年，由于印度对进口商品征收高额税收，导致iPhone价格可能会升高到一个苹果无法在世界上增长最快的智能手机市场中占有一席之地的程度，苹果启动了在印度制造iPhone的进程。 目前，印度约占iPhone全球产能的大约20%。苹果也在印度生产一些组件，包括金属框架，但仍依赖中国公司组装显示屏和其他复杂零件。 马修·摩尔(Matthew Moore)曾在苹果担任制造设计经理长达九年之久。他表示，印度还有一个美国所不具备的优势：“到处都是的工程师。” 摩尔认为，要想吸引苹果和其他电子企业来到美国，特朗普政府需要在科学、技术、工程和数学领域的学位教育方面加大投入。他还表示，美国应当像对住房贷款那样，为新的制造设施提供贷款支持，就像通过房利美和房地美为住房贷款提供支持那样。 上个月，苹果赢得了一丝喘息之机。苹果CEO库克游说特朗普政府，使得苹果手机及其他电子产品获得了关税豁免。不过这只是暂时的，因为美国政府表示计划针对科技产品出台更具针对性的关税措施。 摩尔表示，如果没有政府的投资，苹果以及规模较小的制造商仍会继续在中国生产产品，因为中国拥有充足设备和工程师。摩尔创办了Cruz公司，该公司制造像搅拌机这样的硬件产品。 “我不认为美国已错失机会，但那种认为在四年之内我们就能在本土生产iPhone的想法实在是荒谬之极。这需要十年的时间。”摩尔称。 0 对文章打分 纽约时报：苹果不能没有中国 0 (0%) 1 (100%) 已有 0 条意见 登录 还可以输入320字 [刷新验证码] 最新资讯 02:57 苹果与 Anthropic 合作推出基于 Claude 的 AI 编程平台 据彭博社报道，苹果公司正在与

5月2日，美国《纽约时报》周四发文称，尽管受到了美国政府的施压，苹果公司依旧高度依赖中国。没有中国供应商的支持，苹果的市值恐将缩水一半甚至更多。 苹果北京零售店 早在特朗普涉足政坛之前，苹果及其合作伙伴就在中国各地建起了大型工厂，以组装iPhone。特朗普在首次竞选总统时曾向支持者承诺，他将迫使苹果把这些产品带回美国生产。 然而近十年过去了，情况几乎没有什么改变。苹果并未将制造业带回本土，而是将部分生产从中国转移到了印度、越南和泰国。苹果在美国制造的产品几乎可以忽略不计，估计仍有大约80%的iPhone是在中国生产的。 离不开中国 苹果在中国的根基十分深厚。几十年前，该公司便在中国建立了制造业务，而且不需要与中国企业成立合资公司。随后，苹果在中国完善了低成本组装设备的工艺，并将产品销售给不断壮大的中国中产阶层。苹果深耕中国为其带来了全球超过80%的智能手机利润，以及每年670亿美元的中国市场销售额。 随着时间的推移，苹果与中国的联系愈发紧密。如今，苹果不仅在中国组装大多数iPhone，其中国供应商还负责为印度制造的设备供应零件，并在越南生产组件和AirPods。 尽管这些年来受到了种种压力，但苹果的业务依旧高度依赖中国，以至于没有中国它根本无法运营。特朗普政府试图改变苹果行为的举措，可能会对这家全球市值最高的上市公司造成损害。即便苹果生产迁回至美国在技术上可行，也需要该公司与美国联邦政府共同付出巨大努力。 iPhone 上个月，在特朗普宣布对中国出口商品征收高额关税后的四天内，苹果市值蒸发了7700亿美元。此后，特朗普为中国生产的消费电子品提供了暂时豁免，这才让苹果收复了部分股价损失。 周四，苹果CEO蒂姆·库克(Tim Cook)在财报电话会议上首次回应了关税对公司业绩的影响。他表示，美国关税将导致该公司本季度成本增加9亿美元。 市值腰斩 深水资产管理公司合伙人吉恩·蒙斯特(Gene Munster)预计，最坏情况下，苹果公司的市值会因脱离中国缩水一半甚至更多。这意味着，苹果将从目前的3.2万亿美元跌至1.6万亿美元，原因在于其大约三分之一的销售额依赖于在中国制造的产品，即使苹果将部分生产转移到其他国家也无济于事。 如果再加上失去的中国客户，苹果的市值可能会进一步下滑至1.2万亿美元。 苹果市值的大幅下跌将在整个股市产生连锁反应。该公司在标普500指数中的市值权重约为6%。这意味着，投资者在追踪标普500指数的基金中每投入1美元，就有约6美分投向了苹果股票。投资者以及大多数401(k)退休账户持有人，将看到这部分投资缩水一半。 美施压适得其反 但是在特朗普眼中，苹果对中国的依赖就是制造业岗位的流失。特朗普政府希望将更多电子制造业带回美国。作为全球最有影响力的电子企业，苹果比任何同行都有更大能力实现这一目标。它生产的智能手机数量和其他公司都多，在组件上的支出也超过了竞争对手，因此它能左右供应商的运营所在地。 特朗普政府希望苹果启动制造业回流美国的进程。美国商务部长霍华德·卢特尼克(Howard Lutnick)在今年4月的一次电视采访中表示：“数以百万计的人用螺丝刀拧小螺丝来组装iPhone，这种事情将会来到美国。” 特朗普希望苹果在美国制造 然而，施压苹果离开中国可能会适得其反。新的关税可能迫使苹果提高iPhone售价，或者接受更低的智能手机利润。相比之下，三星的手机是在越南生产的，不受中国关税影响，价格可能更具优势。苹果在本土的竞争力可能因此减弱，这是特朗普通常不愿逾越的红线。 据两位熟悉相关分析情况的匿名知情人士透露，苹果一直不愿在美国生产 iPhone和其他设备，因为该公司的运营团队认为这是不可能实现的。十年前，苹果曾尝试在美国得州组装Mac电脑，结果因螺丝采购困难和难以找到熟练工人而遭受挫折。 而在中国，苹果的供应商可以召集到20万名工人。他们在拥有多年制造经验的数千名工程师监督下工作。大多数工人住在靠近iPhone工厂的宿舍里，显示屏等组件沿着比足球场还长的装配线传送。 市场研究公司TechInsights分析师韦恩·林(Wayne

根据韦恩·林到估算，如果苹果真的在美国建立生产业务，要想维持当前的利润水平，公司可能需要将一部iPhone的售价提高到2000美元，较现在的大约1000美元翻了一番。随着苹果削减工人培训和组件制造成本，iPhone售价可能会在未来降到1500美元。 “从短期来看，这在经济上是不可行的。”韦恩·林表示。他还指出，把一款已经问世接近20年、随时可能被新兴消费电子产品取代的设备生产迁回美国，意义大不大。 政府刺激 苹果已经展现出在有政府激励的情况下调整其供应链的意愿。2017年，由于印度对进口商品征收高额税收，导致iPhone价格可能会升高到一个苹果无法在世界上增长最快的智能手机市场中占有一席之地的程度，苹果启动了在印度制造iPhone的进程。 目前，印度约占iPhone全球产能的大约20%。苹果也在印度生产一些组件，包括金属框架，但仍依赖中国公司组装显示屏和其他复杂零件。

She is the author of ‘The Tech Coup’ Palantir chief executive Alex Karp self-identifies on the “populist-left,” backed Kamala Harris in the US presidential election and once complained that co-founder Peter Thiel’s support for President Donald Trump made his work harder. Despite his conspicuous absence from the inauguration, Karp has emerged as an unlikely cheerleader for the new administration. In recent months, Karp has fallen in lockstep with Elon Musk, calling him the most “qualified person in the world” to remake the US government. It helps that the Doge vision for America bears a great resemblance to that of Palantir. Like Doge, the head of the US software company has an idealised vision of America as a beacon of western democracy. However, this bears little resemblance to the current reality. The contradiction appears most stark regarding US support for Ukraine. When Russia invaded the country in 2022, Palantir rapidly deployed its data analytics services to support the Ukrainian government under siege, pro bono. The company proudly showcases these efforts on its website, highlighting the tactical advantages its technology provides to Ukrainian forces. Yet in recent months, President Trump has drastically cut vital support for Ukraine, publicly humiliated President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and turned his back on European partners. Consider also the controversial detention of international students protesting against Israeli military actions in Gaza. Karp, who has long counted Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as a Palantir customer, condemned the protests while saying nothing about the crackdown on the students involved. On artificial intelligence, Karp maintains a consistently hawkish position. “We must not, however, shy away from building sharp tools for fear they may be turned against us,” he wrote two years ago. He went on to say that free and democratic societies need more than moral appeal: they require hard power. But what happens to those sharp tools in the absence of checks and balances? In his new book The Technological Republic, Karp writes that the tech sector wastes time and talent by developing trivial social media and shopping apps instead of more consequential services. I share this critique that Silicon Valley has lost its way. I also agree with him that many companies fail to take responsibility or action to support democracy. But Trump, with the help of tech leaders, is rapidly making the US less liberal and less democratic. Anyone who supports the west and the rule of law should feel compelled to speak out against this; to draw consequences from the loss of American alliance with other western nations such as those in Europe; or to go on the offensive and challenge the very government that is aggressively undermining the west from within. With numerous alumni now serving in the Trump administration, Palantir wields significant influence. Yet despite positioning the company as an industry outlier and criticising other tech leaders, Karp seems to be going along to get along. Government contracts remain a crucial revenue stream, and Palantir stock has climbed considerably since Trump’s re-election. During an earnings call in February, he told analysts that “whatever is good for America will be good for Americans and very good for Palantir”. But for Palantir’s non-American clients, this unabashed alignment with narrowly defined US state interests may prompt serious reconsideration of their relationships with the company. It’s one thing to talk about defending democratic western values, it’s quite another to do it."," ""https://www.ft.com/content/d26ee3d4-134b-4bae-8ff4-db5fd412ccff"""

Visitors are seen exploring Harman’s automotive electronics display, a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics. (Image provided by Samsung) SEOUL, May 5 (Korea Bizwire) — Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics are seeing robust growth in their automotive electronics divisions, with first-quarter earnings from these units matching or even surpassing those from their flagship home appliance and television businesses—a sign of accelerating transformation in both firms’ business portfolios. According to industry data released on May 4, Samsung’s Harman, the company’s U.S.-based automotive and audio subsidiary, posted 3.4 trillion won ($2.35 billion) in revenue and 300 billion won ($207 million) in operating profit in Q1 2025—on par with the operating profit from Samsung’s Visual Display and Digital Appliances (VD/DA) division, which oversees its TV and home appliance operations. Harman, acquired by Samsung in 2017 for $8 billion, has grown into a key earnings pillar. Known globally for its dominance in digital cockpit systems and in-car audio, Harman supplies premium sound systems under brands such as JBL, Harman Kardon, Bowers & Wilkins, and Bang & Olufsen to leading automakers worldwide. While Harman posted only 60 billion won in operating profit the year it was acquired, it delivered 1.17 trillion won in 2023 and further expanded to 1.3 trillion won last year. Market analysts forecast Harman could reach 1.5 trillion won in operating profit by the end of 2025—potentially overtaking the VD/DA division on an annual basis for the first time. “Harman maintained growth this quarter through improved product mix,” Samsung noted in its earnings release, adding that it expects steady profitability to continue in the second half of the year through expanded automotive revenue.

(Image provided by LG) LG Electronics is also seeing record momentum in its automotive division. The Vehicle Solutions (VS) unit posted 2.84 trillion won ($1.96 billion) in Q1 2025 revenue and 125.1 billion won ($86 million) in operating profit—both quarterly records. VS accounted for nearly 10% of LG’s total operating profit in the quarter, up from just 3.9% a year earlier. The performance far outpaced LG’s MS division, which oversees its TV and PC business and recorded a modest 4.9 billion won in Q1 profit amid intensified competition and higher marketing costs. LG attributed the VS division’s growth to a rising share of premium infotainment system sales. As vehicles become increasingly software-driven, demand has surged for infotainment systems that integrate information and entertainment—a trend LG is capitalizing on. LG’s vehicle components portfolio centers on three pillars: infotainment (VS), EV powertrains (via LG Magna), and automotive lighting (ZKW). Despite global uncertainties, including tariffs and softening EV demand in the U.S., the company said it will focus on product mix improvements and operational efficiencies to sustain earnings momentum. “Despite a slowdown in U.S. vehicle demand and tariff challenges, we expect full-year VS revenue to exceed last year’s level, with profitability improving through internal operational efficiencies,” said Kim Joo-yong, executive director of VS at LG Electronics, during the April 24 earnings call. The surging performance of both Samsung and LG’s automotive businesses underscores a broader pivot toward next-generation mobility solutions as the traditional electronics market matures.

According to industry data released on May 4, Samsung’s Harman, the company’s U.S.-based automotive and audio subsidiary, posted 3.4 trillion won ($2.35 billion) in revenue and 300 billion won ($207 million) in operating profit in Q1 2025—on par with the operating profit from Samsung’s Visual Display and Digital Appliances (VD/DA) division, which oversees its TV and home appliance operations. Harman, acquired by Samsung in 2017 for $8 billion, has grown into a key earnings pillar. Known globally for its dominance in digital cockpit systems and in-car audio, Harman supplies premium sound systems under brands such as JBL, Harman Kardon, Bowers & Wilkins, and Bang & Olufsen to leading automakers worldwide. While Harman posted only 60 billion won in operating profit the year it was acquired, it delivered 1.17 trillion won in 2023 and further expanded to 1.3 trillion won last year. Market analysts forecast Harman could reach 1.5 trillion won in operating profit by the end of 2025—potentially overtaking the VD/DA division on an annual basis for the first time. “Harman maintained growth this quarter through improved product mix,” Samsung noted in its earnings release, adding that it expects steady profitability to continue in the second half of the year through expanded automotive revenue.

Market analysts forecast Harman could reach 1.5 trillion won in operating profit by the end of 2025—potentially overtaking the VD/DA division on an annual basis for the first time. “Harman maintained growth this quarter through improved product mix,” Samsung noted in its earnings release, adding that it expects steady profitability to continue in the second half of the year through expanded automotive revenue.

(Image provided by LG) LG Electronics is also seeing record momentum in its automotive division. The Vehicle Solutions (VS) unit posted 2.84 trillion won ($1.96 billion) in Q1 2025 revenue and 125.1 billion won ($86 million) in operating profit—both quarterly records. VS accounted for nearly 10% of LG’s total operating profit in the quarter, up from just 3.9% a year earlier. The performance far outpaced LG’s MS division, which oversees its TV and PC business and recorded a modest 4.9 billion won in Q1 profit amid intensified competition and higher marketing costs. LG attributed the VS division’s growth to a rising share of premium infotainment system sales. As vehicles become increasingly software-driven, demand has surged for infotainment systems that integrate information and entertainment—a trend LG is capitalizing on. LG’s vehicle components portfolio centers on three pillars: infotainment (VS), EV powertrains (via LG Magna), and automotive lighting (ZKW). Despite global uncertainties, including tariffs and softening EV demand in the U.S., the company said it will focus on product mix improvements and operational efficiencies to sustain earnings momentum. “Despite a slowdown in U.S. vehicle demand and tariff challenges, we expect full-year VS revenue to exceed last year’s level, with profitability improving through internal operational efficiencies,” said Kim Joo-yong, executive director of VS at LG Electronics, during the April 24 earnings call. The surging performance of both Samsung and LG’s automotive businesses underscores a broader pivot toward next-generation mobility solutions as the traditional electronics market matures.

Market analysts forecast Harman could reach 1.5 trillion won in operating profit by the end of 2025—potentially overtaking the VD/DA division on an annual basis for the first time. “Harman maintained growth this quarter through improved product mix,” Samsung noted in its earnings release, adding that it expects steady profitability to continue in the second half of the year through expanded automotive revenue. LG Electronics announced on January 10 that it has been recognized for its advanced future mobility technologies by winning an award at the ‘2025 SDV Innovator Awards,’ organized by global automotive media outlet MotorTrend.

The photo shows Eun Seok-hyun, Executive Vice President and Head of LG’s Vehicle Solutions (VS) Division, who received the award in the ‘Leader’ category. (Image provided by LG) LG Electronics is also seeing record momentum in its automotive division. The Vehicle Solutions (VS) unit posted 2.84 trillion won ($1.96 billion) in Q1 2025 revenue and 125.1 billion won ($86 million) in operating profit—both quarterly records. VS accounted for nearly 10% of LG’s total operating profit in the quarter, up from just 3.9% a year earlier. The performance far outpaced LG’s MS division, which oversees its TV and PC business and recorded a modest 4.9 billion won in Q1 profit amid intensified competition and higher marketing costs. LG attributed the VS division’s growth to a rising share of premium infotainment system sales. As vehicles become increasingly software-driven, demand has surged for infotainment systems that integrate information and entertainment—a trend LG is capitalizing on. LG’s vehicle components portfolio centers on three pillars: infotainment (VS), EV powertrains (via LG Magna), and automotive lighting (ZKW). Despite global uncertainties, including tariffs and softening EV demand in the U.S., the company said it will focus on product mix improvements and operational efficiencies to sustain earnings momentum. “Despite a slowdown in U.S. vehicle demand and tariff challenges, we expect full-year VS revenue to exceed last year’s level, with profitability improving through internal operational efficiencies,” said Kim Joo-yong, executive director of VS at LG Electronics, during the April 24 earnings call. The surging performance of both Samsung and LG’s automotive businesses underscores a broader pivot toward next-generation mobility solutions as the traditional electronics market matures.

"2025-03-18","Apple","Not Affected","Not Affected","Samsung Announces Official Rollout of One UI 7 Starting From April 7 Korea on March 18, 2025 Audio AUDIO Play/Stop Share Share open/close New user interface brings AI-driven enhancements that make everyday interactions more meaningful and intuitive Samsung Electronics today announced that the official rollout of One UI 7 will start April 7,1 bringing a bold new design for greater personalization and control to the user experience. One UI 7 introduces new interface built for AI, helping users interact with their Galaxy devices more naturally than ever before. The update will be available starting with the Galaxy S24 series, Galaxy Z Fold6 and Z Flip6, gradually rolling out to more Galaxy smartphones and tablets. Bold New Design for Greater Personalization One UI 7 comes with a simple, impactful and emotive design, bringing streamlined and cohesive experience to Galaxy users. A simplified home screen, redesigned One UI widgets and lock screen allow users to intuitively and seamlessly customize their devices. For added convenience, Now Bar2 provides real-time updates that matter most right on the lock screen. So during a morning run, users can easily check their progress and see what song is playing in your Galaxy Buds — all with a simple swipe, without unlocking their phone. Smarter AI Features for More Intuitive Experience One UI 7 introduces seamless AI-driven experiences that help users to stay productive and explore their creativity. With Galaxy AI, users can simplify everyday tasks, minimizing the need to switch between applications. AI Select3 intuitively recommends by understanding context. For example, a user can simple swipe the Edge Panel and click ‘AI Select’ icon when watching a video to save it as a GIF file. Writing Assist4 allows users to easily summarize or automatically format contents in which texts can be selected. One UI 7 also enables simple edits to give users more creative control and freedom. Drawing Assist5 helps bring ideas to life with more than a single input, including combinations of text prompts and images or sketches. Audio Eraser6 makes advanced editing accessible for all, by isolating categories of sounds and removing unwanted noise in videos. With deeper Google Gemini7 integration, controlling the device is as easy as speaking to a friend. Long-press the side button and say, “Find Italian, pet-friendly restaurants with outdoor seating nearby.” Gemini instantly pulls up recommendations in one seamless interaction. Natural language search8 extends to Settings, making it easier to adjust preferences.

"2025-03-18","Siemens AG","Not Affected","Not Affected","Samsung Announces Official Rollout of One UI 7 Starting From April 7 Korea on March 18, 2025 Audio AUDIO Play/Stop Share Share open/close New user interface brings AI-driven enhancements that make everyday interactions more meaningful and intuitive Samsung Electronics today announced that the official rollout of One UI 7 will start April 7,1 bringing a bold new design for greater personalization and control to the user experience. One UI 7 introduces new interface built for AI, helping users interact with their Galaxy devices more naturally than ever before. The update will be available starting with the Galaxy S24 series, Galaxy Z Fold6 and Z Flip6, gradually rolling out to more Galaxy smartphones and tablets. Bold New Design for Greater Personalization One UI 7 comes with a simple, impactful and emotive design, bringing streamlined and cohesive experience to Galaxy users. A simplified home screen, redesigned One UI widgets and lock screen allow users to intuitively and seamlessly customize their devices. For added convenience, Now Bar2 provides real-time updates that matter most right on the lock screen. So during a morning run, users can easily check their progress and see what song is playing in your Galaxy Buds — all with a simple swipe, without unlocking their phone. Smarter AI Features for More Intuitive Experience One UI 7 introduces seamless AI-driven experiences that help users to stay productive and explore their creativity. With Galaxy AI, users can simplify everyday tasks, minimizing the need to switch between applications. AI Select3 intuitively recommends by understanding context. For example, a user can simple swipe the Edge Panel and click ‘AI Select’ icon when watching a video to save it as a GIF file. Writing Assist4 allows users to easily summarize or automatically format contents in which texts can be selected. One UI 7 also enables simple edits to give users more creative control and freedom. Drawing Assist5 helps bring ideas to life with more than a single input, including combinations of text prompts and images or sketches. Audio Eraser6 makes advanced editing accessible for all, by isolating categories of sounds and removing unwanted noise in videos. With deeper Google Gemini7 integration, controlling the device is as easy as speaking to a friend. Long-press the side button and say, “Find Italian, pet-friendly restaurants with outdoor seating nearby.” Gemini instantly pulls up recommendations in one seamless interaction. Natural language search8 extends to Settings, making it easier to adjust preferences. Users can simply go into Settings and say “My eyes are feeling tired.” In an instant, recommended options such as adjusting brightness or turning on Eye comfort shield appear.

The company reported consolidated revenue of 79.14 trillion won, or about $59.1 billion, a 4 percent increase from the previous quarter. Operating profit rose to 6.7 trillion won, or $5 billion. Samsung also invested a record 9 trillion won ($6.7 billion) in research and development during the period, underscoring its commitment to long-term growth despite volatile market conditions. AD The company's Device Experience (DX) division led the performance, with revenue climbing 28 percent quarter-over-quarter. Strong sales of flagship smartphones, particularly the Galaxy S25 series, along with an expanded lineup of high-value home appliances, helped drive the division’s gains. The Mobile Experience business recorded robust double-digit profitability, benefiting from solid device momentum, lower component costs, and operational efficiencies. The semiconductor-focused Device Solutions (DS) division reported revenue of 25.1 trillion won and an operating profit of 1.1 trillion won, though sales declined 17 percent from the previous quarter. Server DRAM demand expanded and NAND prices showed early signs of recovery, but High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) sales were hindered by semiconductor export controls. Samsung Display Company recorded revenue of 5.9 trillion won and an operating profit of 0.5 trillion won. Performance in small display panels weakened due to seasonal factors, but the large display segment showed improvement, supported by the introduction of new QD-OLED monitors for major customers. Harman, Samsung’s automotive and audio technology subsidiary, maintained year-over-year growth despite entering a seasonally slower period, posting revenue of 3.4 trillion won and operating profit of 0.3 trillion won, buoyed by a refined product portfolio. Looking ahead to the second quarter, Samsung anticipates a seasonal decline in smartphone demand but will focus on sustaining flagship sales, including its Galaxy S25 Edge model. The Visual Display business plans to launch its 2025 lineup of AI-powered televisions globally, while the home appliance division will target peak-season demand with new Bespoke AI products and air conditioners. For the second half of the year, Samsung is betting on the growing demand for AI server memory, aiming to expand sales of its 12-layer HBM3E and high-capacity DDR5 modules. It also plans to address the emerging trend of on-device AI with the rollout of its 10.7Gbps LPDDR5x technology.

Samsung also invested a record 9 trillion won ($6.7 billion) in research and development during the period, underscoring its commitment to long-term growth despite volatile market conditions. AD The company's Device Experience (DX) division led the performance, with revenue climbing 28 percent quarter-over-quarter.

The semiconductor-focused Device Solutions (DS) division reported revenue of 25.1 trillion won and an operating profit of 1.1 trillion won, though sales declined 17 percent from the previous quarter. Server DRAM demand expanded and NAND prices showed early signs of recovery, but High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) sales were hindered by semiconductor export controls. Samsung Display Company recorded revenue of 5.9 trillion won and an operating profit of 0.5 trillion won. Performance in small display panels weakened due to seasonal factors, but the large display segment showed improvement, supported by the introduction of new QD-OLED monitors for major customers. Harman, Samsung’s automotive and audio technology subsidiary, maintained year-over-year growth despite entering a seasonally slower period, posting revenue of 3.4 trillion won and operating profit of 0.3 trillion won, buoyed by a refined product portfolio. Looking ahead to the second quarter, Samsung anticipates a seasonal decline in smartphone demand but will focus on sustaining flagship sales, including its Galaxy S25 Edge model. The Visual Display business plans to launch its 2025 lineup of AI-powered televisions globally, while the home appliance division will target peak-season demand with new Bespoke AI products and air conditioners. For the second half of the year, Samsung is betting on the growing demand for AI server memory, aiming to expand sales of its 12-layer HBM3E and high-capacity DDR5 modules. It also plans to address the emerging trend of on-device AI with the rollout of its 10.7Gbps LPDDR5x technology.

The company reported consolidated revenue of 79.14 trillion won, or about $59.1 billion, a 4 percent increase from the previous quarter. Operating profit rose to 6.7 trillion won, or $5 billion. Samsung also invested a record 9 trillion won ($6.7 billion) in research and development during the period, underscoring its commitment to long-term growth despite volatile market conditions. AD The company's Device Experience (DX) division led the performance, with revenue climbing 28 percent quarter-over-quarter. Strong sales of flagship smartphones, particularly the Galaxy S25 series, along with an expanded lineup of high-value home appliances, helped drive the division’s gains. The Mobile Experience business recorded robust double-digit profitability, benefiting from solid device momentum, lower component costs, and operational efficiencies. The semiconductor-focused Device Solutions (DS) division reported revenue of 25.1 trillion won and an operating profit of 1.1 trillion won, though sales declined 17 percent from the previous quarter. Server DRAM demand expanded and NAND prices showed early signs of recovery, but High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) sales were hindered by semiconductor export controls. Samsung Display Company recorded revenue of 5.9 trillion won and an operating profit of 0.5 trillion won. Performance in small display panels weakened due to seasonal factors, but the large display segment showed improvement, supported by the introduction of new QD-OLED monitors for major customers. Harman, Samsung’s automotive and audio technology subsidiary, maintained year-over-year growth despite entering a seasonally slower period, posting revenue of 3.4 trillion won and operating profit of 0.3 trillion won, buoyed by a refined product portfolio.

GoTech World digital solutions and innovation exhibition in Bucharest The return of United States President Donald Trump to the White House and his combative stance toward Europe has revived concerns about sovereignty over fundamental technologies, including social media and cloud services, as well as over U.S. law enforcement’s potential access to data processed by ubiquitous giants Amazon, Microsoft and Google. | Robert Ghement/EFE via EPA April 30, 2025 4:01 am CET By Mathieu Pollet The European Union is set to admit that untangling from the dominance of U.S. tech companies is “unrealistic” as fears grow over the bloc’s dependence on American giants. A draft strategy seen by POLITICO ahead of its release this spring signals the EU has few fresh ideas to restore Europe as a serious player in global tech — even as responding to the new transatlantic reality becomes a top priority in Brussels. The return of United States President Donald Trump to the White House and his combative stance toward Europe has revived concerns about sovereignty over fundamental technologies, including social media and cloud services, as well as about the potential access of U.S. law enforcement to data processed by ubiquitous giants Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Advertisement Advertisement In the context of escalating trade tensions and mounting hybrid threats, the EU will soon release its International Digital Strategy for Europe. “Tech competitiveness is an economic and security imperative for all aspiring to durable wealth and stability,” says a draft version dated April 9. Yet when it comes to dominant players such as the U.S., “decoupling is unrealistic and cooperation will remain significant across the technological value chain,” the draft says. It cites China as well as Japan, South Korea and India as countries with which collaboration will also be essential.

The country’s economy expanded by 0.2% in the first quarter from the previous three-month period, preliminary data indicated.

Photo by Hannes P Albert/picture alliance via Getty Images German consumer inflation came in at 2.2% in April on an annual basis, easing slightly from March levels but coming in above expectations, preliminary data showed Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters had estimated a 2.1% reading. The country’s consumer price index, harmonized for comparability across the euro zone, had come in at 2.3% in March on an annual basis. So-called core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, accelerated to 2.9% in April from 2.6% in March. The closely-watched services print also jumped to 3.9%, after a 3.5% reading in the previous month. Energy prices meanwhile dropped sharply, falling by 5.4% according to the statistics office. While the inflation rate closing in on the European Central Bank’s 2% mark is good news for consumers at first glance, there are some less positive points about the data on closer look, Sebastian Becker, economist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note Wednesday. The slight decrease of the headline figures only took place due to lower energy and food costs, he said. “In comparison, the core inflation rate, which is more important for the ECB ... rose notably again.” And services inflation appears “considerably more stubborn than expected,” Becker added. Economic growth Earlier on Wednesday, preliminary data showed that Germany’s economy expanded by 0.2% in the first quarter from the previous three-month period. The figure, released by the German federal statistics office, is adjusted for price, calendar and seasonal variations. The gross domestic product reading was in line with estimates from economists polled by Reuters. Germany’s gross domestic had contracted by 0.2% in the fourth quarter. The statistics office attributed the quarterly increase to the fact “that both household final consumption expenditure and capital formation were higher than in the previous quarter.” While acknowledging Wednesday’s figures were positive, “the quarterly increase is still far too small to end the country’s long-lasting stagnation,” Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, said in a note. Europe’s largest economy has long been sluggish, with its GDP flip-flopping between growth and contraction in each quarter throughout 2023 and 2024. The country has so far avoided technical recession, which is defined by two consecutive quarters of contraction. Key sectors of the economy, such as autos, have been suffering from stronger competition from China. Other industries including housebuilding and infrastructure have also been going through trying times that have been linked to higher costs, muted investment and bureaucratic hurdles. Separately, U.S President Donald Trump’s tariff policies have thrust uncertainty onto export reliant Germany which counts the U.S. as its most important trading partner. As part of the European Union, Germany is facing 20% blanket tariffs on goods exported to the U.S., although these levies have been temporarily reduced to 10% to allow time for negotiations. U.S. duties on steel, aluminum and autos also affect the country. The German government last week cut its economic outlook to predict stagnation in 2025, with outgoing economy minister Robert Habeck saying Trump’s trade policies and their impact on the country were the main factor behind the revision. Fiscal upheaval One bright spot could emerge on the horizon. Germany earlier this year made changes to its long-standing debt brake fiscal rule, enabling higher defense spending, and creating a 500 billion euro ($570 billion) fund dedicated to infrastructure and climate investments. This move has widely been regarded as a positive shift for the German economy, although much still depends on how the changes are implemented. “Today’s GDP report paints a picture of what could have happened if it hadn’t been for US President Donald Trump’s tariff blast – an economy that bottoms out and goes through a weak cyclical rebound, but could gain momentum with the announced fiscal stimulus,” ING’s Brzeski said.

Photo by Hannes P Albert/picture alliance via Getty Images German consumer inflation came in at 2.2% in April on an annual basis, easing slightly from March levels but coming in above expectations, preliminary data showed Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters had estimated a 2.1% reading. The country’s consumer price index, harmonized for comparability across the euro zone, had come in at 2.3% in March on an annual basis. So-called core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, accelerated to 2.9% in April from 2.6% in March. The closely-watched services print also jumped to 3.9%, after a 3.5% reading in the previous month. Energy prices meanwhile dropped sharply, falling by 5.4% according to the statistics office. While the inflation rate closing in on the European Central Bank’s 2% mark is good news for consumers at first glance, there are some less positive points about the data on closer look, Sebastian Becker, economist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note Wednesday. The slight decrease of the headline figures only took place due to lower energy and food costs, he said. “In comparison, the core inflation rate, which is more important for the ECB ... rose notably again.” And services inflation appears “considerably more stubborn than expected,” Becker added. Economic growth Earlier on Wednesday, preliminary data showed that Germany’s economy expanded by 0.2% in the first quarter from the previous three-month period. The figure, released by the German federal statistics office, is adjusted for price, calendar and seasonal variations. The gross domestic product reading was in line with estimates from economists polled by Reuters. Germany’s gross domestic had contracted by 0.2% in the fourth quarter. The statistics office attributed the quarterly increase to the fact “that both household final consumption expenditure and capital formation were higher than in the previous quarter.” While acknowledging Wednesday’s figures were positive, “the quarterly increase is still far too small to end the country’s long-lasting stagnation,” Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, said in a note. Europe’s largest economy has long been sluggish, with its GDP flip-flopping between growth and contraction in each quarter throughout 2023 and 2024. The country has so far avoided technical recession, which is defined by two consecutive quarters of contraction. Key sectors of the economy, such as autos, have been suffering from stronger competition from China. Other industries including housebuilding and infrastructure have also been going through trying times that have been linked to higher costs, muted investment and bureaucratic hurdles. Separately, U.S President Donald Trump’s tariff policies have thrust uncertainty onto export reliant Germany which counts the U.S. as its most important trading partner. As part of the European Union, Germany is facing 20% blanket tariffs on goods exported to the U.S., although these levies have been temporarily reduced to 10% to allow time for negotiations. U.S. duties on steel, aluminum and autos also affect the country. The German government last week cut its economic outlook to predict stagnation in 2025, with outgoing economy minister Robert Habeck saying Trump’s trade policies and their impact on the country were the main factor behind the revision. Fiscal upheaval One bright spot could emerge on the horizon. Germany earlier this year made changes to its long-standing debt brake fiscal rule, enabling higher defense spending, and creating a 500 billion euro ($570 billion) fund dedicated to infrastructure and climate investments. This move has widely been regarded as a positive shift for the German economy, although much still depends on how the changes are implemented. “Today’s GDP report paints a picture of what could have happened if it hadn’t been for US President Donald Trump’s tariff blast – an economy that bottoms out and goes through a weak cyclical rebound, but could gain momentum with the announced fiscal stimulus,” ING’s Brzeski said. While this recovery could still happen, the process now will likely take longer, the analyst said.

Little wonder, then, that Wednesday's newly minted coalition agreement for the incoming administration of Chancellor-designate Friedrich Merz focused heavily on a wholesale economic reboot. Merz has already sent a clear message to the continent that Berlin is out to shake off its fiscal conservatism, relax its notorious debt brake and inject hundreds of billions of euros into its infrastructure and defense as Trump wavers on U.S. commitments to European security. Advertisement Advertisement The coalition agreement between Merz's center-right Christian Democrats and the center-left Social Democrats reads like an economic war plan: tax cuts, energy price reductions and a blitz of public-private investment funds. At its heart is the promise — or gamble — that Germany can regain its competitive edge as global headwinds intensify. ""First of all, we will strengthen the price competitiveness of the German economy,"" Merz declared in Berlin. After a dismal year that saw Germany's economic output shrink by 0.2 percent, even modest growth forecasts for 2025 look fragile, particularly given Trump's global tariff barrage. Merz is framing the coalition agreement as a pro-growth manifesto. A ""Germany Fund"" will be seeded with €10 billion of public money, while an ambitious pitch to private investors aims to increase this to €100 billion to support start-ups and scale up enterprises. The government is also promising an ""investment booster"" — a corporate tax write-down to encourage investment. Advertisement Advertisement ""The future coalition will reform and invest to make Germany ... economically stronger. And Europe can also rely on Germany,"" Merz said. The parties promise to lower electricity taxes, reduce grid fees, abolish a levy on gas prices and introduce an industrial electricity rate — all in the name of reviving industrial production. Voluntary overtime is to be made tax-free. The coalition agreement also declares the steel industry to be of ""key strategic importance."" | Sean Gallup/Getty Images The coalition agreement also declares the steel industry to be of ""key strategic importance"" and endorses carbon capture and storage technology, while promising tax breaks for electric vehicles. While the headlines herald reform, many of the key measures come with delays or caveats, however. A gradual cut in corporation taxes, for example, from 15 percent to 10 percent, won't start before 2028. All about the funding The pact between the parties carries the existential warning that ""all measures in the coalition agreement are subject to financing."" And there's the rub: That funding is far from guaranteed. Advertisement Advertisement The government plans to cut public funding by €1 billion this year and reduce administrative costs by 10 percent by 2029 — with an 8 percent cut in the number of civil servants, excluding security forces. A sweeping review of subsidies and support programs is also underway. A politically sensitive U-turn is hidden in the fine print. The coalition will reinstate the agricultural diesel rebate, whose abolition sparked mass protests by farmers in the winter from 2023 to 2024. Electricity taxes will fall by five cents per kilowatt hour — a long-awaited concession in a country with some of the highest energy prices in the EU. The biggest ideological victory for the conservatives may be the announced repeal of the National Supply Chain Act, a signature Social Democrat policy enacted just two years ago to press companies to vet the sourcing of their goods more rigorously. Cautious optimism The response from economists has been cautiously optimistic, but tempered with a dose of skepticism. Michael Hüther, director of the Cologne-based Institute for Economic Research, called the electricity price reforms a ""strong signal"" to domestic industry in the face of global volatility. The slow-burning corporate tax cut, he said, ""also gives hope."" Advertisement Advertisement But he criticized a perceived lack of clarity. ""Large parts of the coalition agreement read vaguely, and the lines of conflict between SPD and CDU/CSU are very clear, for example on income tax. More courage would have been better here."" Marcel Fratzscher, president of the German Institute for Economic Research, was more blunt. ""There is a lack of ambition,"" he warned. While praising certain aspects of the coalition deal, including infrastructure investment and reform of the defense debt brake, he lamented the lack of a broader tax overhaul and the underwhelming emphasis on Europe's strategic role. More damningly, Fratzscher cast doubt on whether much of the agreement would actually be realized. ""There is a lack of clear implementation strategies,"" he said. The bottom line is that Merz is staking his leadership on the hope that tax cuts and energy reform will turn the economic tide. But with a fragile budget, internal coalition rifts and a skeptical business community, execution will be everything.","https://www.politico.eu/article/facing-huge-trump-tariff-hit-germany-new-government-bets-big-boosting-economy/"

Advertisement Advertisement The coalition agreement between Merz's center-right Christian Democrats and the center-left Social Democrats reads like an economic war plan: tax cuts, energy price reductions and a blitz of public-private investment funds. At its heart is the promise — or gamble — that Germany can regain its competitive edge as global headwinds intensify. ""First of all, we will strengthen the price competitiveness of the German economy,"" Merz declared in Berlin. After a dismal year that saw Germany's economic output shrink by 0.2 percent, even modest growth forecasts for 2025 look fragile, particularly given Trump's global tariff barrage. Merz is framing the coalition agreement as a pro-growth manifesto. A ""Germany Fund"" will be seeded with €10 billion of public money, while an ambitious pitch to private investors aims to increase this to €100 billion to support start-ups and scale up enterprises. The government is also promising an ""investment booster"" — a corporate tax write-down to encourage investment.

The parties promise to lower electricity taxes, reduce grid fees, abolish a levy on gas prices and introduce an industrial electricity rate — all in the name of reviving industrial production. Voluntary overtime is to be made tax-free. The coalition agreement also declares the steel industry to be of ""key strategic importance."" | Sean Gallup/Getty Images The coalition agreement also declares the steel industry to be of ""key strategic importance"" and endorses carbon capture and storage technology, while promising tax breaks for electric vehicles. While the headlines herald reform, many of the key measures come with delays or caveats, however. A gradual cut in corporation taxes, for example, from 15 percent to 10 percent, won't start before 2028. All about the funding The pact between the parties carries the existential warning that ""all measures in the coalition agreement are subject to financing."" And there's the rub: That funding is far from guaranteed. Advertisement Advertisement The government plans to cut public funding by €1 billion this year and reduce administrative costs by 10 percent by 2029 — with an 8 percent cut in the number of civil servants, excluding security forces. A sweeping review of subsidies and support programs is also underway. A politically sensitive U-turn is hidden in the fine print. The coalition will reinstate the agricultural diesel rebate, whose abolition sparked mass protests by farmers in the winter from 2023 to 2024. Electricity taxes will fall by five cents per kilowatt hour — a long-awaited concession in a country with some of the highest energy prices in the EU. The biggest ideological victory for the conservatives may be the announced repeal of the National Supply Chain Act, a signature Social Democrat policy enacted just two years ago to press companies to vet the sourcing of their goods more rigorously.

Michael Hüther, director of the Cologne-based Institute for Economic Research, called the electricity price reforms a ""strong signal"" to domestic industry in the face of global volatility.

Marcel Fratzscher, president of the German Institute for Economic Research, was more blunt. ""There is a lack of ambition,"" he warned. While praising certain aspects of the coalition deal, including infrastructure investment and reform of the defense debt brake, he lamented the lack of a broader tax overhaul and the underwhelming emphasis on Europe's strategic role. More damningly, Fratzscher cast doubt on whether much of the agreement would actually be realized. ""There is a lack of clear implementation strategies,"" he said. The bottom line is that Merz is staking his leadership on the hope that tax cuts and energy reform will turn the economic tide.

Dafür sprach sich das Präsidium der Sozialdemokraten am 30.04.2025 aus. Trotz des historisch schlechtesten Ergebnisses für die SPD bei der Bundestagswahl wurde der 47-Jährige seit Februar zur zentralen Figur der Partei und sicherte sich auch den Fraktionsvorsitz. Diesen muss er bei einem Eintritt ins Kabinett allerdings wieder abgeben. Klingbeil wurde in Soltau geboren und wuchs im benachbarten Munster auf, einer Kleinstadt mit einem der größten Bundeswehrstandorte Deutschlands. Ende 2017 wurde er zum SPD-Generalsekretär. Sein damals größter Erfolg war der Bundestagswahlkampf 2021, an dessen Ende die SPD mit Olaf Scholz als Spitzenkandidat wider Erwarten stärkste Kraft wurde. Im Dezember 2021 übernahm er den Parteivorsitz als Nachfolger von Norbert Walter-Borjans.

In der SPD gehört er aber zum eher konservativen Seeheimer Kreis. Als Finanzminister will er nun das Sondervermögen Infrastruktur vorantreiben und umsetzen, heißt es in einem Schreiben von Klingbeil an die SPD-Bundestagsfraktion, über den als erstes die „Rheinische Post“ berichtete. Bis zum 05. Mai sollen die weiteren fünf Ministerposten der SPD bekannt geben werden. Dazu zählen: Verteidigung, Arbeit und Soziales, Justiz und Verbraucherschutz, Umwelt, Klimaschutz, Naturschutz und nukleare Sicherheit, Wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung und Wohnen, Stadtentwicklung und Bauwesen. Kanzleramtsminister: Thorsten Frei (CDU) Thorsten Frei (CDU) kommt strahlend zur Sitzung vom Bundesvorstand der CDU im Konrad-Adenauer-Haus. Thorsten Frei (CDU), bisher erster parlamentarischer Geschäftsführer der Unionsfraktion im Bundestag, soll Kanzleramtsminister werden. (picture alliance / dpa / Bernd von Jutrczenka) Mit Thorsten Frei soll einer der engsten Vertrauten von Friedrich Merz zum Kanzleramtschef werden. Frei sitze damit an „absolut zentraler Position“, betont der Politikwissenschaftler Thorsten Faas. Der erste parlamentarische Geschäftsführer der Unionsfraktion im Bundestag kommt aus Baden-Württemberg. Dort hat der Jurist auch das politische Handwerk gelernt. Von 2002 bis 2004 war er Regierungsrat im Staatsministerium Baden-Württemberg, von 2004 bis 2013 Oberbürgermeister von Donaueschingen. Seit 2013 sitzt der 52-Jährige im Bundestag. Thorsten Frei sorgte 2013 für Aufregung mit seiner Forderung, das Individualrecht auf Asyl abzuschaffen und durch eine Kontingentlösung zu ersetzen. Bisher ist der CDU-Politiker häufig zu Gast in Talkshows. Im Kanzleramt wird sein Job eher hinter den Kulissen sein.

Mit dem künftigen Bundeskanzler Friedrich Merz teilt sie die Erfahrung einer längeren Auszeit von der aktiven Politik. Reiche zog schon mit 25 Jahren für die CDU in den Bundestag ein. Bis 2015 war sie Abgeordnete und Parlamentarische Staatssekretärin im Umwelt- und später im Verkehrsministerium, bis sie in die Wirtschaft wechselte. Dort war die gebürtige Brandenburgerin zunächst beim Verband kommunaler Unternehmen tätig, der viele Stadtwerke vertritt. 2020 kam die heute 51-Jährige zur E.ON-Tochter Westenergie. Minister für Inneres: Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) Alexander Dobrindt, Vorsitzender der CSU-Landesgruppe, nach der Sitzung des CSU-Vorstands am 28.04.2025 in München Der zukünftige Bundesinnenminister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) gilt als konservativer „Law and Order“-Politiker. (picture alliance / dpa / Revierfoto / Revierfoto) Politisch viel Gewicht bringt Alexander Dobrindt in das Kabinett ein. Für das Bundesinnenministerium hat die CSU ihren langjährigen Landesgruppenchef nominiert. In dieser Position, die Dobrindt seit 2017 innehat, war er intern unumstritten. Als Bundesverkehrsminister (2013-2017) hat er eine gemischte Bilanz hinterlassen: Auf sein Konto geht beispielsweise die gescheiterte „Ausländermaut“.

Der Jurist und ehemalige Zeitsoldat ist seit 2009 Mitglied des Bundestages und gilt als Vertrauter von Friedrich Merz. Wadephul ist stellvertretender Vorsitzender der CDU/CSU-Bundestagsfraktion. Dort ist er zuständig für die Bereiche Auswärtiges, Verteidigung und die Interparlamentarische Konferenz für die Gemeinsame Außen- und Sicherheitspolitik (GASP) und die Gemeinsame Sicherheits- und Verteidigungspolitik (GSVP) und Europarat.

Karsten Wildberger, Vorstandschef des Konzerns Ceconomy und Vorsitzender der Geschäftsführung der Media-Saturn-Holding, soll das Amt im Kabinett von Friedrich Merz übernehmen.

Nach dem Jurastudium in Bonn hat Schnieder zunächst als Rechtsanwalt gearbeitet, bevor er 1998 zum Bürgermeister der Verbandsgemeinde Arzfeld gewählt wurde. 2009 zog der heute 56-Jährige erstmals als direkt gewählter Abgeordneter in den Bundestag ein. In der vergangenen Legislaturperiode war der Jurist stellvertretendes Mitglied im Verkehrsausschuss und als Parlamentarischer Geschäftsführer der CDU/CSU-Bundestagsfraktion Mitglied des Führungskreises um Fraktionschef Merz. Schnieder erwarten große Aufgaben: In seiner künftigen Position wird er eine Schlüsselrolle bei der Umsetzung des Sondervermögens für Infrastruktur spielen. Mit einem großen Teil der 500 Milliarden Euro sollen marode Brücken und das Schienennetz saniert werden.

(picture alliance / dpa / Christoph Schmidt) Diese Personalie war ebenfalls überraschend: Die öffentlich eher unbekannte CDU-Bundestagsabgeordnete Nina Warken soll Bundesgesundheitsministerin werden. Die Rechtsanwältin aus Baden-Württemberg war an den Koalitionsverhandlungen noch in der Arbeitsgruppe Inneres, Recht und Migration beteiligt, Gesundheitspolitik war bisher nicht ihr Schwerpunkt. Im Bundestag saß die Parlamentarische Geschäftsführerin der Unionsfraktion auch im Ältestenrat, zudem ist die 45-Jährige im Bundesvorstand der Frauenunion. Der Politikwissenschaftler Thorsten Faas deutet diese Personalentscheidung „auch in einer Proporzlogik des Regionalen“: Der Landesverband Baden-Württemberg habe früh sehr loyal zu Friedrich Merz gestanden. Der zukünftige Bundeskanzler habe kein riesiges Netzwerk, nachdem er jahrelang außerhalb der Politik war.

Die meinungsstarke und debattenfreudige Juristin lebt in Hamburg und gilt als eine der profiliertesten Bildungspolitikerinnen in der Union.

Mit 47 Jahren ist sie die jüngste der drei für Ministerämter vorgesehenen CSU-Politikerinnen und -Politiker. Dorothee Bär hat seit 2002 Erfahrung im Bundestag und bringt viel Erfahrung im Bereich Hightech mit: Von 2013 bis 2018 war die gebürtige Bambergerin Staatssekretärin beim Bundesministerium für Verkehr und digitale Infrastruktur, von 2018 bis 2021 Staatsministerin im Bundeskanzleramt und Beauftragte der Bundesregierung für Digitalisierung.

Der Metzgermeister aus Straubing in Niederbayern hat noch immer einen Betrieb zusammen mit seinem Sohn. Alois Rainer ist politisch hervorragend vernetzt, seine Schwester ist die ehemalige CSU-Bundesministerin Gerda Hasselfeldt. Sein Vater war Landtags- und Bundestagsabgeordneter. Für die CSU passt der Niederbayer perfekt ins Landwirtschaftsministerium: Er verkörpert das Thema Heimat und gilt als äußerst bodenständig.

(picture alliance / HMB Media / Uwe Koch) Eine besondere Rolle hat der Beauftragte der Bundesregierung für Kultur und Medien, auch bekannt als Kulturstaatsminister. Dieser Posten ist kein Ministeramt, der Staatsminister hat daher kein Abstimmungsrecht, er sitzt aber mit am Kabinettstisch. Viele Namen wurden im Vorfeld für das Amt gehandelt. Übernehmen soll es nun der Publizist und Verleger Wolfram Weimer. Der 60-Jährige war Chefredakteur von „Welt“ und „Focus“ und gründete das Magazin „Cicero“. Er gilt als CDU-nah, hat aber kein Parteibuch. Weimer und Merz haben auch eine persönliche Verbindung, kennen sich aus dem sehr wohlhabenden Kosmos am oberbayerischen Tegernsee und sind zusammen Golfen gegangen.

KommentarWolfram Weimer muss das Vertrauen in die Kulturwelt bewahren 03:17 Minuten28.04.2025 Der Publizist Weimer steht für soliden Journalismus, aber auch für polarisierende Publizistik: Auf dem Höhepunkt der Migrationsdebatte schrieb er etwa im „Cicero“ von der „Multikulti-Lüge“, sein Buch „Das konservative Manifest“ beschrieb er selbst als „Gift für Linke und eine Zumutung für Rechte“. Seine Äußerungen deuten nicht auf ein liberal-, sondern erzkonservatives Weltbild hin. Die Personalie Weimer ist daher umstritten. Die Kulturwelt wird sich nach Claudia Roth (Grüne) und der Merkel-Vertrauten Monika Grütters (CDU) als Kulturstaatsministerinnen erst an den konservativen Weimer gewöhnen müssen. Weimer bringt zudem ein doppeltes Manko mit: Der Publizist hat weder Erfahrung in der Politik noch sind Kontakte in die Kulturwelt bekannt. Gleichzeitig steht er vor der Aufgabe, die Kulturwelt sowie Geld und Mehrheiten für die Kultur zu organisieren.

Thomas Weikert, Präsident des Deutschen Olympischen Sportbundes, zeigte sich darüber erfreut, dass das Amt überhaupt eingerichtet wurde. Die deutsche Sportwelt erhofft sich von dem neu geschaffenen Posten, dass der Sport näher an den Kabinettstisch rückt.

Lars Klingbeil – trotz des schlechten SPD-Abschneidens bei der Bundestagswahl wird er zum zweitmächtigsten Mann der Regierung nach dem Bundeskanzler (picture alliance / dpa / Matthias Bein) Lars Klingbeil soll das mächtige Finanzressort verantworten und zudem Vizekanzler werden. Dafür sprach sich das Präsidium der Sozialdemokraten am 30.04.2025 aus. Trotz des historisch schlechtesten Ergebnisses für die SPD bei der Bundestagswahl wurde der 47-Jährige seit Februar zur zentralen Figur der Partei und sicherte sich auch den Fraktionsvorsitz. Diesen muss er bei einem Eintritt ins Kabinett allerdings wieder abgeben. Klingbeil wurde in Soltau geboren und wuchs im benachbarten Munster auf, einer Kleinstadt mit einem der größten Bundeswehrstandorte Deutschlands. Ende 2017 wurde er zum SPD-Generalsekretär. Sein damals größter Erfolg war der Bundestagswahlkampf 2021, an dessen Ende die SPD mit Olaf Scholz als Spitzenkandidat wider Erwarten stärkste Kraft wurde. Im Dezember 2021 übernahm er den Parteivorsitz als Nachfolger von Norbert Walter-Borjans.

In der SPD gehört er aber zum eher konservativen Seeheimer Kreis. Als Finanzminister will er nun das Sondervermögen Infrastruktur vorantreiben und umsetzen, heißt es in einem Schreiben von Klingbeil an die SPD-Bundestagsfraktion, über den als erstes die „Rheinische Post“ berichtete. Bis zum 05. Mai sollen die weiteren fünf Ministerposten der SPD bekannt geben werden. Dazu zählen: Verteidigung, Arbeit und Soziales, Justiz und Verbraucherschutz, Umwelt, Klimaschutz, Naturschutz und nukleare Sicherheit, Wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung und Wohnen, Stadtentwicklung und Bauwesen. Kanzleramtsminister: Thorsten Frei (CDU) Thorsten Frei (CDU) kommt strahlend zur Sitzung vom Bundesvorstand der CDU im Konrad-Adenauer-Haus.

(picture alliance / dpa / Bernd von Jutrczenka) Mit Thorsten Frei soll einer der engsten Vertrauten von Friedrich Merz zum Kanzleramtschef werden. Frei sitze damit an „absolut zentraler Position“, betont der Politikwissenschaftler Thorsten Faas. Der erste parlamentarische Geschäftsführer der Unionsfraktion im Bundestag kommt aus Baden-Württemberg. Dort hat der Jurist auch das politische Handwerk gelernt. Von 2002 bis 2004 war er Regierungsrat im Staatsministerium Baden-Württemberg, von 2004 bis 2013 Oberbürgermeister von Donaueschingen. Seit 2013 sitzt der 52-Jährige im Bundestag. Thorsten Frei sorgte 2013 für Aufregung mit seiner Forderung, das Individualrecht auf Asyl abzuschaffen und durch eine Kontingentlösung zu ersetzen. Bisher ist der CDU-Politiker häufig zu Gast in Talkshows. Im Kanzleramt wird sein Job eher hinter den Kulissen sein.

Dafür sprach sich das Präsidium der Sozialdemokraten am 30.04.2025 aus. Trotz des historisch schlechtesten Ergebnisses für die SPD bei der Bundestagswahl wurde der 47-Jährige seit Februar zur zentralen Figur der Partei und sicherte sich auch den Fraktionsvorsitz. Diesen muss er bei einem Eintritt ins Kabinett allerdings wieder abgeben. Klingbeil wurde in Soltau geboren und wuchs im benachbarten Munster auf, einer Kleinstadt mit einem der größten Bundeswehrstandorte Deutschlands. Ende 2017 wurde er zum SPD-Generalsekretär. Sein damals größter Erfolg war der Bundestagswahlkampf 2021, an dessen Ende die SPD mit Olaf Scholz als Spitzenkandidat wider Erwarten stärkste Kraft wurde. Im Dezember 2021 übernahm er den Parteivorsitz als Nachfolger von Norbert Walter-Borjans.

In der SPD gehört er aber zum eher konservativen Seeheimer Kreis. Als Finanzminister will er nun das Sondervermögen Infrastruktur vorantreiben und umsetzen, heißt es in einem Schreiben von Klingbeil an die SPD-Bundestagsfraktion, über den als erstes die „Rheinische Post“ berichtete. Bis zum 05. Mai sollen die weiteren fünf Ministerposten der SPD bekannt geben werden. Dazu zählen: Verteidigung, Arbeit und Soziales, Justiz und Verbraucherschutz, Umwelt, Klimaschutz, Naturschutz und nukleare Sicherheit, Wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung und Wohnen, Stadtentwicklung und Bauwesen. Kanzleramtsminister: Thorsten Frei (CDU) Thorsten Frei (CDU) kommt strahlend zur Sitzung vom Bundesvorstand der CDU im Konrad-Adenauer-Haus. Thorsten Frei (CDU), bisher erster parlamentarischer Geschäftsführer der Unionsfraktion im Bundestag, soll Kanzleramtsminister werden. (picture alliance / dpa / Bernd von Jutrczenka) Mit Thorsten Frei soll einer der engsten Vertrauten von Friedrich Merz zum Kanzleramtschef werden. Frei sitze damit an „absolut zentraler Position“, betont der Politikwissenschaftler Thorsten Faas. Der erste parlamentarische Geschäftsführer der Unionsfraktion im Bundestag kommt aus Baden-Württemberg. Dort hat der Jurist auch das politische Handwerk gelernt. Von 2002 bis 2004 war er Regierungsrat im Staatsministerium Baden-Württemberg, von 2004 bis 2013 Oberbürgermeister von Donaueschingen. Seit 2013 sitzt der 52-Jährige im Bundestag. Thorsten Frei sorgte 2013 für Aufregung mit seiner Forderung, das Individualrecht auf Asyl abzuschaffen und durch eine Kontingentlösung zu ersetzen. Bisher ist der CDU-Politiker häufig zu Gast in Talkshows. Im Kanzleramt wird sein Job eher hinter den Kulissen sein. Dort wird seine Aufgabe sein, für Merz Fallstricke aus dem Weg räumen, einen reibungslosen Regierungsablauf zu sichern und Kontakt zu den Bundesländern zu halten.

(picture alliance / dpa / Kay Nietfeld) Von der Vorstandsvorsitzenden des Energieversorgers Westenergie an die Spitze des Wirtschaftsministeriums: Die Nominierung der Diplomchemikerin Katherina Reiche ist eine Überraschung. Mit dem künftigen Bundeskanzler Friedrich Merz teilt sie die Erfahrung einer längeren Auszeit von der aktiven Politik. Reiche zog schon mit 25 Jahren für die CDU in den Bundestag ein. Bis 2015 war sie Abgeordnete und Parlamentarische Staatssekretärin im Umwelt- und später im Verkehrsministerium, bis sie in die Wirtschaft wechselte. Dort war die gebürtige Brandenburgerin zunächst beim Verband kommunaler Unternehmen tätig, der viele Stadtwerke vertritt. 2020 kam die heute 51-Jährige zur E.ON-Tochter Westenergie. Minister für Inneres: Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) Alexander Dobrindt, Vorsitzender der CSU-Landesgruppe, nach der Sitzung des CSU-Vorstands am 28.04.2025 in München Der zukünftige Bundesinnenminister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) gilt als konservativer „Law and Order“-Politiker. (picture alliance / dpa / Revierfoto / Revierfoto) Politisch viel Gewicht bringt Alexander Dobrindt in das Kabinett ein. Für das Bundesinnenministerium hat die CSU ihren langjährigen Landesgruppenchef nominiert. In dieser Position, die Dobrindt seit 2017 innehat, war er intern unumstritten. Als Bundesverkehrsminister (2013-2017) hat er eine gemischte Bilanz hinterlassen: Auf sein Konto geht beispielsweise die gescheiterte „Ausländermaut“. Der designierte Bundesinnenminister Alexander Dobrindt steht im Innenhof der CSU-Parteizentrale neben dem CSU-Logo. CSUDobrindt soll neuer Bundesinnenminister werden 04:14 Minuten28.04.2025 Dobrindt steht für einen sehr konservativen Kurs und „Law and Order“-Politik. Er durfte sich offenbar sein Ministerium aussuchen und entschied sich mit dem Innenministerium für einen Posten, der zentral für die Union und die gesamte Bundesregierung ist. Er muss die Versprechen in der Sicherheits- und Asylpolitik umsetzen, die CDU/CSU im Wahlkampf gegeben haben. Auswärtiges Amt: Johann Wadephul (CDU) Johann Wadephul (CDU) steht am Rande einer Pressekonferenz der Parteivorsitzenden von Union und SPD zur Vorstellung des Koalitionsvertrages im Paul-Löbe-Haus. Mit Johann Wadephul (CDU) wird ein profilierter Außen- und Sicherheitspolitikexperte der neue Chef im Auswärtigen Amt. (picture alliance / dpa / Michael Kappeler) Das Außenministerium geht nach fast 60 Jahren erstmals wieder an die CDU. Leiten soll es der Außen- und Sicherheitsexperte Johann Wadephul aus Schleswig-Holstein. Der Jurist und ehemalige Zeitsoldat ist seit 2009 Mitglied des Bundestages und gilt als Vertrauter von Friedrich Merz. Wadephul ist stellvertretender Vorsitzender der CDU/CSU-Bundestagsfraktion. Dort ist er zuständig für die Bereiche Auswärtiges, Verteidigung und die Interparlamentarische Konferenz für die Gemeinsame Außen- und Sicherheitspolitik (GASP) und die Gemeinsame Sicherheits- und Verteidigungspolitik (GSVP) und Europarat. Seit November 2024 ist Wadephul Vizepräsident der parlamentarischen Versammlung der NATO. Zuletzt besuchte er die Außenminister Frankreichs, Polens, Italiens und Großbritanniens.

Er blickt direkt in die Kamera. Vom CEO zum Digitalisierungsminister: Mit Karsten Wildberger kommt ein Topmanager aus der Wirtschaft ins Kabinett. (picture alliance / dpa / Kay Nietfeld) Eine Überraschung ist die Besetzung des neu geschaffenen Ressorts für Digitalisierung und Staatsmodernisierung. Karsten Wildberger, Vorstandschef des Konzerns Ceconomy und Vorsitzender der Geschäftsführung der Media-Saturn-Holding, soll das Amt im Kabinett von Friedrich Merz übernehmen. Im Laufe seiner Karriere hat der promovierte Physiker internationale Führungspositionen unter anderem bei T-Mobile, Vodafone und dem australischen Telekommunikationsunternehmen Telstar bekleidet. Dlf Audiothek Karsten WildbergerWer ist der CEO und zukünftige Digitalminister? 01:30 Minuten28.04.2025 Die digitale Transformation in Wirtschaft und Unternehmenswelt gehörte in den vergangenen Jahren zum Kern seiner Tätigkeiten. Nach Bekanntgabe seiner Berufung bat Wildberger den Ceconomy-Aufsichtsrat darum, ihn zum 5. Mai von seinen Aufgaben zu entbinden. Unter seiner Führung hatte Ceconomy als Elektronikmärkte-Betreiber das Onlinegeschäft ausgebaut. Der Aktienkurs ist seit Amtsantritt von Wildberger im August 2021 allerdings um gut 20 Prozent geschrumpft. Verkehr: Patrick Schnieder (CDU) Patrick Schnieder (CDU), zukünftiger Bundesminister für Verkehr, kommt zur Sitzung des CDU-Bundesausschusses ins Estrel Hotel. Er schaut direkt in die Kamera. Als künftiger Verkehrsminister wird Patrick Schnieder (CDU) die Aufgabe zukommen, marode Schienen und Brücken zu sanieren. (picture alliance / Jörg Carstensen / Joerg Carstensen) Das Verkehrsressort wird mit dem CDU-Bundestagsabgeordneten Patrick Schnieder ein erfahrener Parlamentarier aus Rheinland-Pfalz übernehmen. Nach dem Jurastudium in Bonn hat Schnieder zunächst als Rechtsanwalt gearbeitet, bevor er 1998 zum Bürgermeister der Verbandsgemeinde Arzfeld gewählt wurde. 2009 zog der heute 56-Jährige erstmals als direkt gewählter Abgeordneter in den Bundestag ein. In der vergangenen Legislaturperiode war der Jurist stellvertretendes Mitglied im Verkehrsausschuss und als Parlamentarischer Geschäftsführer der CDU/CSU-Bundestagsfraktion Mitglied des Führungskreises um Fraktionschef Merz. Schnieder erwarten große Aufgaben: In seiner künftigen Position wird er eine Schlüsselrolle bei der Umsetzung des Sondervermögens für Infrastruktur spielen. Mit einem großen Teil der 500 Milliarden Euro sollen marode Brücken und das Schienennetz saniert werden. Ministerin für Gesundheit: Nina Warken (CDU) Nina Warken (CDU) spricht bei einer Pressekonferenz über die Ergebnisse des Treffens der Südwest-CDU im Kloster Schöntal. Die CDU-Bundestagsabgeordnete Nina Warken soll neue Gesundheitsministerin werden. (picture alliance / dpa / Christoph Schmidt) Diese Personalie war ebenfalls überraschend: Die öffentlich eher unbekannte CDU-Bundestagsabgeordnete Nina Warken soll Bundesgesundheitsministerin werden. Die Rechtsanwältin aus Baden-Württemberg war an den Koalitionsverhandlungen noch in der Arbeitsgruppe Inneres, Recht und Migration beteiligt, Gesundheitspolitik war bisher nicht ihr Schwerpunkt. Im Bundestag saß die Parlamentarische Geschäftsführerin der Unionsfraktion auch im Ältestenrat, zudem ist die 45-Jährige im Bundesvorstand der Frauenunion. Der Politikwissenschaftler Thorsten Faas deutet diese Personalentscheidung „auch in einer Proporzlogik des Regionalen“: Der Landesverband Baden-Württemberg habe früh sehr loyal zu Friedrich Merz gestanden. Der zukünftige Bundeskanzler habe kein riesiges Netzwerk, nachdem er jahrelang außerhalb der Politik war. Bildung und Familie: Karin Prien (CDU) Karin Prien (CDU), designierte Bundesministerin für Bildung, Familie, Senioren, Frauen und Jugend, aufgenommen beim Bundesausschuss der CDU. Karin Prien gilt als eine der profiliertesten Bildungspolitikerinnen in der Union. (picture alliance / dpa / Michael Kappeler) Als Ressortchefin für Bildung und Familie ist die schleswig-holsteinische Bildungsministerin Karin Prien vorgesehen. Ihre Familie war vor den Nazis in die Niederlande geflohen, Prien und ihr jüngerer Bruder kamen in Amsterdam zur Welt. Die meinungsstarke und debattenfreudige Juristin lebt in Hamburg und gilt als eine der profiliertesten Bildungspolitikerinnen in der Union. Karin Prien ist bereits seit 1981 CDU-Mitglied und hat sich schon als Bürgerschaftsabgeordnete in Hamburg für Bildungsthemen engagiert. Seit 2017 ist sie in Schleswig-Holstein Ministerin für Bildung, Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kultur. Forschung und Raumfahrt: Dorothee Bär (CSU) Politikerin Dorothee Bär, stellvertretende Parteivorsitzende der CSU, zu Gast in der ARD-Talkshow ""Hart aber Fair"" Die stellvertretende CSU-Vorsitzende Dorothee Bär soll im künftigen Kabinett das Forschungs- und Raumfahrtministerium leiten. (picture alliance / dpa / Horst Galuschka) In der CSU genießt Dorothee Bär den Respekt ihrer Parteigenossen und der Parteiführung: Markus Söder lobt sie als sehr durchsetzungsstark. Mit 47 Jahren ist sie die jüngste der drei für Ministerämter vorgesehenen CSU-Politikerinnen und -Politiker. Dorothee Bär hat seit 2002 Erfahrung im Bundestag und bringt viel Erfahrung im Bereich Hightech mit: Von 2013 bis 2018 war die gebürtige Bambergerin Staatssekretärin beim Bundesministerium für Verkehr und digitale Infrastruktur, von 2018 bis 2021 Staatsministerin im Bundeskanzleramt und Beauftragte der Bundesregierung für Digitalisierung. Landwirtschaft: Alois Rainer (CSU) Der designierte Bundeslandwirtschaftsminister Alois Rainer steht nach der CSU-Vorstandssitzung für ein Porträt im Innenhof der Parteizentrale. Mit Alois Rainer (CSU) übernimmt ein gelernter Metzger aus Niederbayern das Landwirtschaftsministerium. (picture alliance / dpa / Peter Kneffel) Als weitere Überraschung gilt die Entscheidung für den niederbayerischen Bundestagsabgeordneten Alois Rainer als Bundeslandwirtschaftsminister. Der Metzgermeister aus Straubing in Niederbayern hat noch immer einen Betrieb zusammen mit seinem Sohn. Alois Rainer ist politisch hervorragend vernetzt, seine Schwester ist die ehemalige CSU-Bundesministerin Gerda Hasselfeldt. Sein Vater war Landtags- und Bundestagsabgeordneter. Für die CSU passt der Niederbayer perfekt ins Landwirtschaftsministerium: Er verkörpert das Thema Heimat und gilt als äußerst bodenständig. Staatsminister für Kultur und Medien: Wolfram Weimer (parteilos) Porträt von Wolfram Weimer in einem Fernsehstudio. Er trägt Brille und lacht. Eine umstrittene Personalie: Der parteilose Publizist und Verleger Wolfram Weimer soll Kulturstaatsminister werden. (picture alliance / HMB Media / Uwe Koch) Eine besondere Rolle hat der Beauftragte der Bundesregierung für Kultur und Medien, auch bekannt als Kulturstaatsminister. Dieser Posten ist kein Ministeramt, der Staatsminister hat daher kein Abstimmungsrecht, er sitzt aber mit am Kabinettstisch. Viele Namen wurden im Vorfeld für das Amt gehandelt. Übernehmen soll es nun der Publizist und Verleger Wolfram Weimer. Der 60-Jährige war Chefredakteur von „Welt“ und „Focus“ und gründete das Magazin „Cicero“. Er gilt als CDU-nah, hat aber kein Parteibuch. Weimer und Merz haben auch eine persönliche Verbindung, kennen sich aus dem sehr wohlhabenden Kosmos am oberbayerischen Tegernsee und sind zusammen Golfen gegangen. Wolfram Weimer, designierter Staatsminister für Kultur und Medien Wolfram WeimerEin konservativer Quereinsteiger wird Kulturstaatsminister Friedrich Merz schüttelt Wolfram Weimer die Hand. Zwischen ihnen steht die CDU-Parteivorsitzender, Nina Warken, designierte Bundesministerin für Gesundheit. KommentarWolfram Weimer muss das Vertrauen in die Kulturwelt bewahren 03:17 Minuten28.04.2025 Der Publizist Weimer steht für soliden Journalismus, aber auch für polarisierende Publizistik: Auf dem Höhepunkt der Migrationsdebatte schrieb er etwa im „Cicero“ von der „Multikulti-Lüge“, sein Buch „Das konservative Manifest“ beschrieb er selbst als „Gift für Linke und eine Zumutung für Rechte“. Seine Äußerungen deuten nicht auf ein liberal-, sondern erzkonservatives Weltbild hin. Die Personalie Weimer ist daher umstritten. Die Kulturwelt wird sich nach Claudia Roth (Grüne) und der Merkel-Vertrauten Monika Grütters (CDU) als Kulturstaatsministerinnen erst an den konservativen Weimer gewöhnen müssen. Weimer bringt zudem ein doppeltes Manko mit: Der Publizist hat weder Erfahrung in der Politik noch sind Kontakte in die Kulturwelt bekannt. Gleichzeitig steht er vor der Aufgabe, die Kulturwelt sowie Geld und Mehrheiten für die Kultur zu organisieren. Staatsministerin für Sport und Ehrenamt: Christiane Schenderlein (CDU) Christiane Schenderlein (CDU), designierte Staatsministerin für Sport und Ehrenamt.

Die CDU-Bundestagsabgeordnete Nina Warken soll neue Gesundheitsministerin werden. (picture alliance / dpa / Christoph Schmidt) Diese Personalie war ebenfalls überraschend: Die öffentlich eher unbekannte CDU-Bundestagsabgeordnete Nina Warken soll Bundesgesundheitsministerin werden. Die Rechtsanwältin aus Baden-Württemberg war an den Koalitionsverhandlungen noch in der Arbeitsgruppe Inneres, Recht und Migration beteiligt, Gesundheitspolitik war bisher nicht ihr Schwerpunkt. Im Bundestag saß die Parlamentarische Geschäftsführerin der Unionsfraktion auch im Ältestenrat, zudem ist die 45-Jährige im Bundesvorstand der Frauenunion. Der Politikwissenschaftler Thorsten Faas deutet diese Personalentscheidung „auch in einer Proporzlogik des Regionalen“: Der Landesverband Baden-Württemberg habe früh sehr loyal zu Friedrich Merz gestanden. Der zukünftige Bundeskanzler habe kein riesiges Netzwerk, nachdem er jahrelang außerhalb der Politik war.

Karin Prien gilt als eine der profiliertesten Bildungspolitikerinnen in der Union. (picture alliance / dpa / Michael Kappeler) Als Ressortchefin für Bildung und Familie ist die schleswig-holsteinische Bildungsministerin Karin Prien vorgesehen. Ihre Familie war vor den Nazis in die Niederlande geflohen, Prien und ihr jüngerer Bruder kamen in Amsterdam zur Welt. Die meinungsstarke und debattenfreudige Juristin lebt in Hamburg und gilt als eine der profiliertesten Bildungspolitikerinnen in der Union. Karin Prien ist bereits seit 1981 CDU-Mitglied und hat sich schon als Bürgerschaftsabgeordnete in Hamburg für Bildungsthemen engagiert. Seit 2017 ist sie in Schleswig-Holstein Ministerin für Bildung, Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kultur.

(picture alliance / dpa / Horst Galuschka) In der CSU genießt Dorothee Bär den Respekt ihrer Parteigenossen und der Parteiführung: Markus Söder lobt sie als sehr durchsetzungsstark. Mit 47 Jahren ist sie die jüngste der drei für Ministerämter vorgesehenen CSU-Politikerinnen und -Politiker. Dorothee Bär hat seit 2002 Erfahrung im Bundestag und bringt viel Erfahrung im Bereich Hightech mit: Von 2013 bis 2018 war die gebürtige Bambergerin Staatssekretärin beim Bundesministerium für Verkehr und digitale Infrastruktur, von 2018 bis 2021 Staatsministerin im Bundeskanzleramt und Beauftragte der Bundesregierung für Digitalisierung.

Mit Alois Rainer (CSU) übernimmt ein gelernter Metzger aus Niederbayern das Landwirtschaftsministerium. (picture alliance / dpa / Peter Kneffel) Als weitere Überraschung gilt die Entscheidung für den niederbayerischen Bundestagsabgeordneten Alois Rainer als Bundeslandwirtschaftsminister. Der Metzgermeister aus Straubing in Niederbayern hat noch immer einen Betrieb zusammen mit seinem Sohn. Alois Rainer ist politisch hervorragend vernetzt, seine Schwester ist die ehemalige CSU-Bundesministerin Gerda Hasselfeldt. Sein Vater war Landtags- und Bundestagsabgeordneter. Für die CSU passt der Niederbayer perfekt ins Landwirtschaftsministerium: Er verkörpert das Thema Heimat und gilt als äußerst bodenständig. Staatsminister für Kultur und Medien: Wolfram Weimer (parteilos) Porträt von Wolfram Weimer in einem Fernsehstudio. Er trägt Brille und lacht. Eine umstrittene Personalie: Der parteilose Publizist und Verleger Wolfram Weimer soll Kulturstaatsminister werden. (picture alliance / HMB Media / Uwe Koch) Eine besondere Rolle hat der Beauftragte der Bundesregierung für Kultur und Medien, auch bekannt als Kulturstaatsminister. Dieser Posten ist kein Ministeramt, der Staatsminister hat daher kein Abstimmungsrecht, er sitzt aber mit am Kabinettstisch. Viele Namen wurden im Vorfeld für das Amt gehandelt. Übernehmen soll es nun der Publizist und Verleger Wolfram Weimer. Der 60-Jährige war Chefredakteur von „Welt“ und „Focus“ und gründete das Magazin „Cicero“. Er gilt als CDU-nah, hat aber kein Parteibuch. Weimer und Merz haben auch eine persönliche Verbindung, kennen sich aus dem sehr wohlhabenden Kosmos am oberbayerischen Tegernsee und sind zusammen Golfen gegangen.

Zwischen ihnen steht die CDU-Parteivorsitzender, Nina Warken, designierte Bundesministerin für Gesundheit. KommentarWolfram Weimer muss das Vertrauen in die Kulturwelt bewahren 03:17 Minuten28.04.2025 Der Publizist Weimer steht für soliden Journalismus, aber auch für polarisierende Publizistik: Auf dem Höhepunkt der Migrationsdebatte schrieb er etwa im „Cicero“ von der „Multikulti-Lüge“, sein Buch „Das konservative Manifest“ beschrieb er selbst als „Gift für Linke und eine Zumutung für Rechte“. Seine Äußerungen deuten nicht auf ein liberal-, sondern erzkonservatives Weltbild hin. Die Personalie Weimer ist daher umstritten. Die Kulturwelt wird sich nach Claudia Roth (Grüne) und der Merkel-Vertrauten Monika Grütters (CDU) als Kulturstaatsministerinnen erst an den konservativen Weimer gewöhnen müssen. Weimer bringt zudem ein doppeltes Manko mit: Der Publizist hat weder Erfahrung in der Politik noch sind Kontakte in die Kulturwelt bekannt. Gleichzeitig steht er vor der Aufgabe, die Kulturwelt sowie Geld und Mehrheiten für die Kultur zu organisieren.

Schenderlein ist zwar mit dem Thema Ehrenamt vertraut, sportpolitisch bislang aber nicht in Erscheinung getreten. Die 43-jährige promovierte Philosophin war Experten und Sportfunktionären bisher eher unbekannt. Thomas Weikert, Präsident des Deutschen Olympischen Sportbundes, zeigte sich darüber erfreut, dass das Amt überhaupt eingerichtet wurde. Die deutsche Sportwelt erhofft sich von dem neu geschaffenen Posten, dass der Sport näher an den Kabinettstisch rückt.

Dafür sprach sich das Präsidium der Sozialdemokraten am 30.04.2025 aus. Trotz des historisch schlechtesten Ergebnisses für die SPD bei der Bundestagswahl wurde der 47-Jährige seit Februar zur zentralen Figur der Partei und sicherte sich auch den Fraktionsvorsitz. Diesen muss er bei einem Eintritt ins Kabinett allerdings wieder abgeben. Klingbeil wurde in Soltau geboren und wuchs im benachbarten Munster auf, einer Kleinstadt mit einem der größten Bundeswehrstandorte Deutschlands. Ende 2017 wurde er zum SPD-Generalsekretär. Sein damals größter Erfolg war der Bundestagswahlkampf 2021, an dessen Ende die SPD mit Olaf Scholz als Spitzenkandidat wider Erwarten stärkste Kraft wurde.

Thorsten Frei (CDU), bisher erster parlamentarischer Geschäftsführer der Unionsfraktion im Bundestag, soll Kanzleramtsminister werden. (picture alliance / dpa / Bernd von Jutrczenka) Mit Thorsten Frei soll einer der engsten Vertrauten von Friedrich Merz zum Kanzleramtschef werden. Frei sitze damit an „absolut zentraler Position“, betont der Politikwissenschaftler Thorsten Faas. Der erste parlamentarische Geschäftsführer der Unionsfraktion im Bundestag kommt aus Baden-Württemberg. Dort hat der Jurist auch das politische Handwerk gelernt. Von 2002 bis 2004 war er Regierungsrat im Staatsministerium Baden-Württemberg, von 2004 bis 2013 Oberbürgermeister von Donaueschingen. Seit 2013 sitzt der 52-Jährige im Bundestag. Thorsten Frei sorgte 2013 für Aufregung mit seiner Forderung, das Individualrecht auf Asyl abzuschaffen und durch eine Kontingentlösung zu ersetzen. Bisher ist der CDU-Politiker häufig zu Gast in Talkshows. Im Kanzleramt wird sein Job eher hinter den Kulissen sein. Dort wird seine Aufgabe sein, für Merz Fallstricke aus dem Weg räumen, einen reibungslosen Regierungsablauf zu sichern und Kontakt zu den Bundesländern zu halten.

(picture alliance / dpa / Kay Nietfeld) Von der Vorstandsvorsitzenden des Energieversorgers Westenergie an die Spitze des Wirtschaftsministeriums: Die Nominierung der Diplomchemikerin Katherina Reiche ist eine Überraschung. Mit dem künftigen Bundeskanzler Friedrich Merz teilt sie die Erfahrung einer längeren Auszeit von der aktiven Politik. Reiche zog schon mit 25 Jahren für die CDU in den Bundestag ein. Bis 2015 war sie Abgeordnete und Parlamentarische Staatssekretärin im Umwelt- und später im Verkehrsministerium, bis sie in die Wirtschaft wechselte. Dort war die gebürtige Brandenburgerin zunächst beim Verband kommunaler Unternehmen tätig, der viele Stadtwerke vertritt. 2020 kam die heute 51-Jährige zur E.ON-Tochter Westenergie.

(picture alliance / dpa / Revierfoto / Revierfoto) Politisch viel Gewicht bringt Alexander Dobrindt in das Kabinett ein. Für das Bundesinnenministerium hat die CSU ihren langjährigen Landesgruppenchef nominiert. In dieser Position, die Dobrindt seit 2017 innehat, war er intern unumstritten. Als Bundesverkehrsminister (2013-2017) hat er eine gemischte Bilanz hinterlassen: Auf sein Konto geht beispielsweise die gescheiterte „Ausländermaut“. Der designierte Bundesinnenminister Alexander Dobrindt steht im Innenhof der CSU-Parteizentrale neben dem CSU-Logo. CSUDobrindt soll neuer Bundesinnenminister werden 04:14 Minuten28.04.2025 Dobrindt steht für einen sehr konservativen Kurs und „Law and Order“-Politik. Er durfte sich offenbar sein Ministerium aussuchen und entschied sich mit dem Innenministerium für einen Posten, der zentral für die Union und die gesamte Bundesregierung ist. Er muss die Versprechen in der Sicherheits- und Asylpolitik umsetzen, die CDU/CSU im Wahlkampf gegeben haben.

(picture alliance / dpa / Michael Kappeler) Das Außenministerium geht nach fast 60 Jahren erstmals wieder an die CDU. Leiten soll es der Außen- und Sicherheitsexperte Johann Wadephul aus Schleswig-Holstein. Der Jurist und ehemalige Zeitsoldat ist seit 2009 Mitglied des Bundestages und gilt als Vertrauter von Friedrich Merz. Wadephul ist stellvertretender Vorsitzender der CDU/CSU-Bundestagsfraktion. Dort ist er zuständig für die Bereiche Auswärtiges, Verteidigung und die Interparlamentarische Konferenz für die Gemeinsame Außen- und Sicherheitspolitik (GASP) und die Gemeinsame Sicherheits- und Verteidigungspolitik (GSVP) und Europarat. Seit November 2024 ist Wadephul Vizepräsident der parlamentarischen Versammlung der NATO. Zuletzt besuchte er die Außenminister Frankreichs, Polens, Italiens und Großbritanniens.

(picture alliance / dpa / Kay Nietfeld) Eine Überraschung ist die Besetzung des neu geschaffenen Ressorts für Digitalisierung und Staatsmodernisierung. Karsten Wildberger, Vorstandschef des Konzerns Ceconomy und Vorsitzender der Geschäftsführung der Media-Saturn-Holding, soll das Amt im Kabinett von Friedrich Merz übernehmen. Im Laufe seiner Karriere hat der promovierte Physiker internationale Führungspositionen unter anderem bei T-Mobile, Vodafone und dem australischen Telekommunikationsunternehmen Telstar bekleidet. Dlf Audiothek Karsten WildbergerWer ist der CEO und zukünftige Digitalminister? 01:30 Minuten28.04.2025 Die digitale Transformation in Wirtschaft und Unternehmenswelt gehörte in den vergangenen Jahren zum Kern seiner Tätigkeiten. Nach Bekanntgabe seiner Berufung bat Wildberger den Ceconomy-Aufsichtsrat darum, ihn zum 5. Mai von seinen Aufgaben zu entbinden. Unter seiner Führung hatte Ceconomy als Elektronikmärkte-Betreiber das Onlinegeschäft ausgebaut. Der Aktienkurs ist seit Amtsantritt von Wildberger im August 2021 allerdings um gut 20 Prozent geschrumpft.

Nach dem Jurastudium in Bonn hat Schnieder zunächst als Rechtsanwalt gearbeitet, bevor er 1998 zum Bürgermeister der Verbandsgemeinde Arzfeld gewählt wurde. 2009 zog der heute 56-Jährige erstmals als direkt gewählter Abgeordneter in den Bundestag ein. In der vergangenen Legislaturperiode war der Jurist stellvertretendes Mitglied im Verkehrsausschuss und als Parlamentarischer Geschäftsführer der CDU/CSU-Bundestagsfraktion Mitglied des Führungskreises um Fraktionschef Merz.

Bisher ist der CDU-Politiker häufig zu Gast in Talkshows. Im Kanzleramt wird sein Job eher hinter den Kulissen sein. Dort wird seine Aufgabe sein, für Merz Fallstricke aus dem Weg räumen, einen reibungslosen Regierungsablauf zu sichern und Kontakt zu den Bundesländern zu halten.

Mit dem künftigen Bundeskanzler Friedrich Merz teilt sie die Erfahrung einer längeren Auszeit von der aktiven Politik. Reiche zog schon mit 25 Jahren für die CDU in den Bundestag ein. Bis 2015 war sie Abgeordnete und Parlamentarische Staatssekretärin im Umwelt- und später im Verkehrsministerium, bis sie in die Wirtschaft wechselte. Dort war die gebürtige Brandenburgerin zunächst beim Verband kommunaler Unternehmen tätig, der viele Stadtwerke vertritt. 2020 kam die heute 51-Jährige zur E.ON-Tochter Westenergie. Minister für Inneres: Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) Alexander Dobrindt, Vorsitzender der CSU-Landesgruppe, nach der Sitzung des CSU-Vorstands am 28.04.2025 in München Der zukünftige Bundesinnenminister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) gilt als konservativer „Law and Order“-Politiker.

Für das Bundesinnenministerium hat die CSU ihren langjährigen Landesgruppenchef nominiert. In dieser Position, die Dobrindt seit 2017 innehat, war er intern unumstritten. Als Bundesverkehrsminister (2013-2017) hat er eine gemischte Bilanz hinterlassen: Auf sein Konto geht beispielsweise die gescheiterte „Ausländermaut“.

Der Jurist und ehemalige Zeitsoldat ist seit 2009 Mitglied des Bundestages und gilt als Vertrauter von Friedrich Merz. Wadephul ist stellvertretender Vorsitzender der CDU/CSU-Bundestagsfraktion. Dort ist er zuständig für die Bereiche Auswärtiges, Verteidigung und die Interparlamentarische Konferenz für die Gemeinsame Außen- und Sicherheitspolitik (GASP) und die Gemeinsame Sicherheits- und Verteidigungspolitik (GSVP) und Europarat.

Karsten Wildberger, Vorstandschef des Konzerns Ceconomy und Vorsitzender der Geschäftsführung der Media-Saturn-Holding, soll das Amt im Kabinett von Friedrich Merz übernehmen. Im Laufe seiner Karriere hat der promovierte Physiker internationale Führungspositionen unter anderem bei T-Mobile, Vodafone und dem australischen Telekommunikationsunternehmen Telstar bekleidet.

(picture alliance / Jörg Carstensen / Joerg Carstensen) Das Verkehrsressort wird mit dem CDU-Bundestagsabgeordneten Patrick Schnieder ein erfahrener Parlamentarier aus Rheinland-Pfalz übernehmen. Nach dem Jurastudium in Bonn hat Schnieder zunächst als Rechtsanwalt gearbeitet, bevor er 1998 zum Bürgermeister der Verbandsgemeinde Arzfeld gewählt wurde. 2009 zog der heute 56-Jährige erstmals als direkt gewählter Abgeordneter in den Bundestag ein. In der vergangenen Legislaturperiode war der Jurist stellvertretendes Mitglied im Verkehrsausschuss und als Parlamentarischer Geschäftsführer der CDU/CSU-Bundestagsfraktion Mitglied des Führungskreises um Fraktionschef Merz. Schnieder erwarten große Aufgaben: In seiner künftigen Position wird er eine Schlüsselrolle bei der Umsetzung des Sondervermögens für Infrastruktur spielen. Mit einem großen Teil der 500 Milliarden Euro sollen marode Brücken und das Schienennetz saniert werden.

(picture alliance / dpa / Christoph Schmidt) Diese Personalie war ebenfalls überraschend: Die öffentlich eher unbekannte CDU-Bundestagsabgeordnete Nina Warken soll Bundesgesundheitsministerin werden. Die Rechtsanwältin aus Baden-Württemberg war an den Koalitionsverhandlungen noch in der Arbeitsgruppe Inneres, Recht und Migration beteiligt, Gesundheitspolitik war bisher nicht ihr Schwerpunkt. Im Bundestag saß die Parlamentarische Geschäftsführerin der Unionsfraktion auch im Ältestenrat, zudem ist die 45-Jährige im Bundesvorstand der Frauenunion. Der Politikwissenschaftler Thorsten Faas deutet diese Personalentscheidung „auch in einer Proporzlogik des Regionalen“: Der Landesverband Baden-Württemberg habe früh sehr loyal zu Friedrich Merz gestanden. Der zukünftige Bundeskanzler habe kein riesiges Netzwerk, nachdem er jahrelang außerhalb der Politik war.

Die meinungsstarke und debattenfreudige Juristin lebt in Hamburg und gilt als eine der profiliertesten Bildungspolitikerinnen in der Union.

Mit 47 Jahren ist sie die jüngste der drei für Ministerämter vorgesehenen CSU-Politikerinnen und -Politiker. Dorothee Bär hat seit 2002 Erfahrung im Bundestag und bringt viel Erfahrung im Bereich Hightech mit: Von 2013 bis 2018 war die gebürtige Bambergerin Staatssekretärin beim Bundesministerium für Verkehr und digitale Infrastruktur, von 2018 bis 2021 Staatsministerin im Bundeskanzleramt und Beauftragte der Bundesregierung für Digitalisierung.

(picture alliance / dpa / Peter Kneffel) Als weitere Überraschung gilt die Entscheidung für den niederbayerischen Bundestagsabgeordneten Alois Rainer als Bundeslandwirtschaftsminister. Der Metzgermeister aus Straubing in Niederbayern hat noch immer einen Betrieb zusammen mit seinem Sohn. Alois Rainer ist politisch hervorragend vernetzt, seine Schwester ist die ehemalige CSU-Bundesministerin Gerda Hasselfeldt. Sein Vater war Landtags- und Bundestagsabgeordneter. Für die CSU passt der Niederbayer perfekt ins Landwirtschaftsministerium: Er verkörpert das Thema Heimat und gilt als äußerst bodenständig.

(picture alliance / HMB Media / Uwe Koch) Eine besondere Rolle hat der Beauftragte der Bundesregierung für Kultur und Medien, auch bekannt als Kulturstaatsminister. Dieser Posten ist kein Ministeramt, der Staatsminister hat daher kein Abstimmungsrecht, er sitzt aber mit am Kabinettstisch. Viele Namen wurden im Vorfeld für das Amt gehandelt. Übernehmen soll es nun der Publizist und Verleger Wolfram Weimer. Der 60-Jährige war Chefredakteur von „Welt“ und „Focus“ und gründete das Magazin „Cicero“. Er gilt als CDU-nah, hat aber kein Parteibuch. Weimer und Merz haben auch eine persönliche Verbindung, kennen sich aus dem sehr wohlhabenden Kosmos am oberbayerischen Tegernsee und sind zusammen Golfen gegangen. Wolfram Weimer, designierter Staatsminister für Kultur und Medien Wolfram WeimerEin konservativer Quereinsteiger wird Kulturstaatsminister Friedrich Merz schüttelt Wolfram Weimer die Hand. Zwischen ihnen steht die CDU-Parteivorsitzender, Nina Warken, designierte Bundesministerin für Gesundheit. KommentarWolfram Weimer muss das Vertrauen in die Kulturwelt bewahren 03:17 Minuten28.04.2025 Der Publizist Weimer steht für soliden Journalismus, aber auch für polarisierende Publizistik: Auf dem Höhepunkt der Migrationsdebatte schrieb er etwa im „Cicero“ von der „Multikulti-Lüge“, sein Buch „Das konservative Manifest“ beschrieb er selbst als „Gift für Linke und eine Zumutung für Rechte“. Seine Äußerungen deuten nicht auf ein liberal-, sondern erzkonservatives Weltbild hin. Die Personalie Weimer ist daher umstritten. Die Kulturwelt wird sich nach Claudia Roth (Grüne) und der Merkel-Vertrauten Monika Grütters (CDU) als Kulturstaatsministerinnen erst an den konservativen Weimer gewöhnen müssen. Weimer bringt zudem ein doppeltes Manko mit: Der Publizist hat weder Erfahrung in der Politik noch sind Kontakte in die Kulturwelt bekannt. Gleichzeitig steht er vor der Aufgabe, die Kulturwelt sowie Geld und Mehrheiten für die Kultur zu organisieren.

Die Entscheidung für Christiane Schenderlein aus Nordsachsen ist eine weitere Überraschung. Schenderlein ist zwar mit dem Thema Ehrenamt vertraut, sportpolitisch bislang aber nicht in Erscheinung getreten. Die 43-jährige promovierte Philosophin war Experten und Sportfunktionären bisher eher unbekannt. Thomas Weikert, Präsident des Deutschen Olympischen Sportbundes, zeigte sich darüber erfreut, dass das Amt überhaupt eingerichtet wurde. Die deutsche Sportwelt erhofft sich von dem neu geschaffenen Posten, dass der Sport näher an den Kabinettstisch rückt. Außerdem freut man sich über die Bündelung der bislang auf verschiedene Ressorts verteilten Sportthemen an einer zentralen Ansprechstelle direkt im Kanzleramt.

Dafür sprach sich das Präsidium der Sozialdemokraten am 30.04.2025 aus. Trotz des historisch schlechtesten Ergebnisses für die SPD bei der Bundestagswahl wurde der 47-Jährige seit Februar zur zentralen Figur der Partei und sicherte sich auch den Fraktionsvorsitz. Diesen muss er bei einem Eintritt ins Kabinett allerdings wieder abgeben. Klingbeil wurde in Soltau geboren und wuchs im benachbarten Munster auf, einer Kleinstadt mit einem der größten Bundeswehrstandorte Deutschlands. Ende 2017 wurde er zum SPD-Generalsekretär. Sein damals größter Erfolg war der Bundestagswahlkampf 2021, an dessen Ende die SPD mit Olaf Scholz als Spitzenkandidat wider Erwarten stärkste Kraft wurde. Im Dezember 2021 übernahm er den Parteivorsitz als Nachfolger von Norbert Walter-Borjans.

Als Finanzminister will er nun das Sondervermögen Infrastruktur vorantreiben und umsetzen, heißt es in einem Schreiben von Klingbeil an die SPD-Bundestagsfraktion, über den als erstes die „Rheinische Post“ berichtete. Bis zum 05. Mai sollen die weiteren fünf Ministerposten der SPD bekannt geben werden. Dazu zählen: Verteidigung, Arbeit und Soziales, Justiz und Verbraucherschutz, Umwelt, Klimaschutz, Naturschutz und nukleare Sicherheit, Wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung und Wohnen, Stadtentwicklung und Bauwesen.

Die 43-jährige promovierte Philosophin war Experten und Sportfunktionären bisher eher unbekannt. Thomas Weikert, Präsident des Deutschen Olympischen Sportbundes, zeigte sich darüber erfreut, dass das Amt überhaupt eingerichtet wurde. Die deutsche Sportwelt erhofft sich von dem neu geschaffenen Posten, dass der Sport näher an den Kabinettstisch rückt.

Dafür sprach sich das Präsidium der Sozialdemokraten am 30.04.2025 aus. Trotz des historisch schlechtesten Ergebnisses für die SPD bei der Bundestagswahl wurde der 47-Jährige seit Februar zur zentralen Figur der Partei und sicherte sich auch den Fraktionsvorsitz. Diesen muss er bei einem Eintritt ins Kabinett allerdings wieder abgeben. Klingbeil wurde in Soltau geboren und wuchs im benachbarten Munster auf, einer Kleinstadt mit einem der größten Bundeswehrstandorte Deutschlands. Ende 2017 wurde er zum SPD-Generalsekretär. Sein damals größter Erfolg war der Bundestagswahlkampf 2021, an dessen Ende die SPD mit Olaf Scholz als Spitzenkandidat wider Erwarten stärkste Kraft wurde.

Als Finanzminister will er nun das Sondervermögen Infrastruktur vorantreiben und umsetzen, heißt es in einem Schreiben von Klingbeil an die SPD-Bundestagsfraktion, über den als erstes die „Rheinische Post“ berichtete. Bis zum 05. Mai sollen die weiteren fünf Ministerposten der SPD bekannt geben werden. Dazu zählen: Verteidigung, Arbeit und Soziales, Justiz und Verbraucherschutz, Umwelt, Klimaschutz, Naturschutz und nukleare Sicherheit, Wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung und Wohnen, Stadtentwicklung und Bauwesen. Kanzleramtsminister: Thorsten Frei (CDU) Thorsten Frei (CDU) kommt strahlend zur Sitzung vom Bundesvorstand der CDU im Konrad-Adenauer-Haus. Thorsten Frei (CDU), bisher erster parlamentarischer Geschäftsführer der Unionsfraktion im Bundestag, soll Kanzleramtsminister werden. (picture alliance / dpa / Bernd von Jutrczenka) Mit Thorsten Frei soll einer der engsten Vertrauten von Friedrich Merz zum Kanzleramtschef werden. Frei sitze damit an „absolut zentraler Position“, betont der Politikwissenschaftler Thorsten Faas. Der erste parlamentarische Geschäftsführer der Unionsfraktion im Bundestag kommt aus Baden-Württemberg. Dort hat der Jurist auch das politische Handwerk gelernt. Von 2002 bis 2004 war er Regierungsrat im Staatsministerium Baden-Württemberg, von 2004 bis 2013 Oberbürgermeister von Donaueschingen. Seit 2013 sitzt der 52-Jährige im Bundestag. Thorsten Frei sorgte 2013 für Aufregung mit seiner Forderung, das Individualrecht auf Asyl abzuschaffen und durch eine Kontingentlösung zu ersetzen. Bisher ist der CDU-Politiker häufig zu Gast in Talkshows. Im Kanzleramt wird sein Job eher hinter den Kulissen sein. Dort wird seine Aufgabe sein, für Merz Fallstricke aus dem Weg räumen, einen reibungslosen Regierungsablauf zu sichern und Kontakt zu den Bundesländern zu halten.

(picture alliance / dpa / Kay Nietfeld) Von der Vorstandsvorsitzenden des Energieversorgers Westenergie an die Spitze des Wirtschaftsministeriums: Die Nominierung der Diplomchemikerin Katherina Reiche ist eine Überraschung. Mit dem künftigen Bundeskanzler Friedrich Merz teilt sie die Erfahrung einer längeren Auszeit von der aktiven Politik. Reiche zog schon mit 25 Jahren für die CDU in den Bundestag ein. Bis 2015 war sie Abgeordnete und Parlamentarische Staatssekretärin im Umwelt- und später im Verkehrsministerium, bis sie in die Wirtschaft wechselte. Dort war die gebürtige Brandenburgerin zunächst beim Verband kommunaler Unternehmen tätig, der viele Stadtwerke vertritt. 2020 kam die heute 51-Jährige zur E.ON-Tochter Westenergie. Minister für Inneres: Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) Alexander Dobrindt, Vorsitzender der CSU-Landesgruppe, nach der Sitzung des CSU-Vorstands am 28.04.2025 in München Der zukünftige Bundesinnenminister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) gilt als konservativer „Law and Order“-Politiker. (picture alliance / dpa / Revierfoto / Revierfoto) Politisch viel Gewicht bringt Alexander Dobrindt in das Kabinett ein. Für das Bundesinnenministerium hat die CSU ihren langjährigen Landesgruppenchef nominiert. In dieser Position, die Dobrindt seit 2017 innehat, war er intern unumstritten. Als Bundesverkehrsminister (2013-2017) hat er eine gemischte Bilanz hinterlassen: Auf sein Konto geht beispielsweise die gescheiterte „Ausländermaut“. Der designierte Bundesinnenminister Alexander Dobrindt steht im Innenhof der CSU-Parteizentrale neben dem CSU-Logo. CSUDobrindt soll neuer Bundesinnenminister werden 04:14 Minuten28.04.2025 Dobrindt steht für einen sehr konservativen Kurs und „Law and Order“-Politik. Er durfte sich offenbar sein Ministerium aussuchen und entschied sich mit dem Innenministerium für einen Posten, der zentral für die Union und die gesamte Bundesregierung ist. Er muss die Versprechen in der Sicherheits- und Asylpolitik umsetzen, die CDU/CSU im Wahlkampf gegeben haben. Auswärtiges Amt: Johann Wadephul (CDU) Johann Wadephul (CDU) steht am Rande einer Pressekonferenz der Parteivorsitzenden von Union und SPD zur Vorstellung des Koalitionsvertrages im Paul-Löbe-Haus. Mit Johann Wadephul (CDU) wird ein profilierter Außen- und Sicherheitspolitikexperte der neue Chef im Auswärtigen Amt. (picture alliance / dpa / Michael Kappeler) Das Außenministerium geht nach fast 60 Jahren erstmals wieder an die CDU. Leiten soll es der Außen- und Sicherheitsexperte Johann Wadephul aus Schleswig-Holstein. Der Jurist und ehemalige Zeitsoldat ist seit 2009 Mitglied des Bundestages und gilt als Vertrauter von Friedrich Merz. Wadephul ist stellvertretender Vorsitzender der CDU/CSU-Bundestagsfraktion. Dort ist er zuständig für die Bereiche Auswärtiges, Verteidigung und die Interparlamentarische Konferenz für die Gemeinsame Außen- und Sicherheitspolitik (GASP) und die Gemeinsame Sicherheits- und Verteidigungspolitik (GSVP) und Europarat. Seit November 2024 ist Wadephul Vizepräsident der parlamentarischen Versammlung der NATO. Zuletzt besuchte er die Außenminister Frankreichs, Polens, Italiens und Großbritanniens.

Er blickt direkt in die Kamera. Vom CEO zum Digitalisierungsminister: Mit Karsten Wildberger kommt ein Topmanager aus der Wirtschaft ins Kabinett. (picture alliance / dpa / Kay Nietfeld) Eine Überraschung ist die Besetzung des neu geschaffenen Ressorts für Digitalisierung und Staatsmodernisierung. Karsten Wildberger, Vorstandschef des Konzerns Ceconomy und Vorsitzender der Geschäftsführung der Media-Saturn-Holding, soll das Amt im Kabinett von Friedrich Merz übernehmen. Im Laufe seiner Karriere hat der promovierte Physiker internationale Führungspositionen unter anderem bei T-Mobile, Vodafone und dem australischen Telekommunikationsunternehmen Telstar bekleidet. Dlf Audiothek Karsten WildbergerWer ist der CEO und zukünftige Digitalminister? 01:30 Minuten28.04.2025 Die digitale Transformation in Wirtschaft und Unternehmenswelt gehörte in den vergangenen Jahren zum Kern seiner Tätigkeiten. Nach Bekanntgabe seiner Berufung bat Wildberger den Ceconomy-Aufsichtsrat darum, ihn zum 5. Mai von seinen Aufgaben zu entbinden. Unter seiner Führung hatte Ceconomy als Elektronikmärkte-Betreiber das Onlinegeschäft ausgebaut. Der Aktienkurs ist seit Amtsantritt von Wildberger im August 2021 allerdings um gut 20 Prozent geschrumpft. Verkehr: Patrick Schnieder (CDU) Patrick Schnieder (CDU), zukünftiger Bundesminister für Verkehr, kommt zur Sitzung des CDU-Bundesausschusses ins Estrel Hotel. Er schaut direkt in die Kamera. Als künftiger Verkehrsminister wird Patrick Schnieder (CDU) die Aufgabe zukommen, marode Schienen und Brücken zu sanieren. (picture alliance / Jörg Carstensen / Joerg Carstensen) Das Verkehrsressort wird mit dem CDU-Bundestagsabgeordneten Patrick Schnieder ein erfahrener Parlamentarier aus Rheinland-Pfalz übernehmen. Nach dem Jurastudium in Bonn hat Schnieder zunächst als Rechtsanwalt gearbeitet, bevor er 1998 zum Bürgermeister der Verbandsgemeinde Arzfeld gewählt wurde. 2009 zog der heute 56-Jährige erstmals als direkt gewählter Abgeordneter in den Bundestag ein. In der vergangenen Legislaturperiode war der Jurist stellvertretendes Mitglied im Verkehrsausschuss und als Parlamentarischer Geschäftsführer der CDU/CSU-Bundestagsfraktion Mitglied des Führungskreises um Fraktionschef Merz. Schnieder erwarten große Aufgaben: In seiner künftigen Position wird er eine Schlüsselrolle bei der Umsetzung des Sondervermögens für Infrastruktur spielen. Mit einem großen Teil der 500 Milliarden Euro sollen marode Brücken und das Schienennetz saniert werden. Ministerin für Gesundheit: Nina Warken (CDU) Nina Warken (CDU) spricht bei einer Pressekonferenz über die Ergebnisse des Treffens der Südwest-CDU im Kloster Schöntal. Die CDU-Bundestagsabgeordnete Nina Warken soll neue Gesundheitsministerin werden. (picture alliance / dpa / Christoph Schmidt) Diese Personalie war ebenfalls überraschend: Die öffentlich eher unbekannte CDU-Bundestagsabgeordnete Nina Warken soll Bundesgesundheitsministerin werden. Die Rechtsanwältin aus Baden-Württemberg war an den Koalitionsverhandlungen noch in der Arbeitsgruppe Inneres, Recht und Migration beteiligt, Gesundheitspolitik war bisher nicht ihr Schwerpunkt. Im Bundestag saß die Parlamentarische Geschäftsführerin der Unionsfraktion auch im Ältestenrat, zudem ist die 45-Jährige im Bundesvorstand der Frauenunion. Der Politikwissenschaftler Thorsten Faas deutet diese Personalentscheidung „auch in einer Proporzlogik des Regionalen“: Der Landesverband Baden-Württemberg habe früh sehr loyal zu Friedrich Merz gestanden. Der zukünftige Bundeskanzler habe kein riesiges Netzwerk, nachdem er jahrelang außerhalb der Politik war. Bildung und Familie: Karin Prien (CDU) Karin Prien (CDU), designierte Bundesministerin für Bildung, Familie, Senioren, Frauen und Jugend, aufgenommen beim Bundesausschuss der CDU. Karin Prien gilt als eine der profiliertesten Bildungspolitikerinnen in der Union. (picture alliance / dpa / Michael Kappeler) Als Ressortchefin für Bildung und Familie ist die schleswig-holsteinische Bildungsministerin Karin Prien vorgesehen. Ihre Familie war vor den Nazis in die Niederlande geflohen, Prien und ihr jüngerer Bruder kamen in Amsterdam zur Welt. Die meinungsstarke und debattenfreudige Juristin lebt in Hamburg und gilt als eine der profiliertesten Bildungspolitikerinnen in der Union. Karin Prien ist bereits seit 1981 CDU-Mitglied und hat sich schon als Bürgerschaftsabgeordnete in Hamburg für Bildungsthemen engagiert. Seit 2017 ist sie in Schleswig-Holstein Ministerin für Bildung, Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kultur. Forschung und Raumfahrt: Dorothee Bär (CSU) Politikerin Dorothee Bär, stellvertretende Parteivorsitzende der CSU, zu Gast in der ARD-Talkshow ""Hart aber Fair"" Die stellvertretende CSU-Vorsitzende Dorothee Bär soll im künftigen Kabinett das Forschungs- und Raumfahrtministerium leiten. (picture alliance / dpa / Horst Galuschka) In der CSU genießt Dorothee Bär den Respekt ihrer Parteigenossen und der Parteiführung: Markus Söder lobt sie als sehr durchsetzungsstark. Mit 47 Jahren ist sie die jüngste der drei für Ministerämter vorgesehenen CSU-Politikerinnen und -Politiker. Dorothee Bär hat seit 2002 Erfahrung im Bundestag und bringt viel Erfahrung im Bereich Hightech mit: Von 2013 bis 2018 war die gebürtige Bambergerin Staatssekretärin beim Bundesministerium für Verkehr und digitale Infrastruktur, von 2018 bis 2021 Staatsministerin im Bundeskanzleramt und Beauftragte der Bundesregierung für Digitalisierung. Landwirtschaft: Alois Rainer (CSU) Der designierte Bundeslandwirtschaftsminister Alois Rainer steht nach der CSU-Vorstandssitzung für ein Porträt im Innenhof der Parteizentrale. Mit Alois Rainer (CSU) übernimmt ein gelernter Metzger aus Niederbayern das Landwirtschaftsministerium. (picture alliance / dpa / Peter Kneffel) Als weitere Überraschung gilt die Entscheidung für den niederbayerischen Bundestagsabgeordneten Alois Rainer als Bundeslandwirtschaftsminister. Der Metzgermeister aus Straubing in Niederbayern hat noch immer einen Betrieb zusammen mit seinem Sohn. Alois Rainer ist politisch hervorragend vernetzt, seine Schwester ist die ehemalige CSU-Bundesministerin Gerda Hasselfeldt. Sein Vater war Landtags- und Bundestagsabgeordneter. Für die CSU passt der Niederbayer perfekt ins Landwirtschaftsministerium: Er verkörpert das Thema Heimat und gilt als äußerst bodenständig. Staatsminister für Kultur und Medien: Wolfram Weimer (parteilos) Porträt von Wolfram Weimer in einem Fernsehstudio. Er trägt Brille und lacht. Eine umstrittene Personalie: Der parteilose Publizist und Verleger Wolfram Weimer soll Kulturstaatsminister werden. (picture alliance / HMB Media / Uwe Koch) Eine besondere Rolle hat der Beauftragte der Bundesregierung für Kultur und Medien, auch bekannt als Kulturstaatsminister. Dieser Posten ist kein Ministeramt, der Staatsminister hat daher kein Abstimmungsrecht, er sitzt aber mit am Kabinettstisch. Viele Namen wurden im Vorfeld für das Amt gehandelt. Übernehmen soll es nun der Publizist und Verleger Wolfram Weimer. Der 60-Jährige war Chefredakteur von „Welt“ und „Focus“ und gründete das Magazin „Cicero“. Er gilt als CDU-nah, hat aber kein Parteibuch. Weimer und Merz haben auch eine persönliche Verbindung, kennen sich aus dem sehr wohlhabenden Kosmos am oberbayerischen Tegernsee und sind zusammen Golfen gegangen. Wolfram Weimer, designierter Staatsminister für Kultur und Medien Wolfram WeimerEin konservativer Quereinsteiger wird Kulturstaatsminister Friedrich Merz schüttelt Wolfram Weimer die Hand. Zwischen ihnen steht die CDU-Parteivorsitzender, Nina Warken, designierte Bundesministerin für Gesundheit. KommentarWolfram Weimer muss das Vertrauen in die Kulturwelt bewahren 03:17 Minuten28.04.2025 Der Publizist Weimer steht für soliden Journalismus, aber auch für polarisierende Publizistik: Auf dem Höhepunkt der Migrationsdebatte schrieb er etwa im „Cicero“ von der „Multikulti-Lüge“, sein Buch „Das konservative Manifest“ beschrieb er selbst als „Gift für Linke und eine Zumutung für Rechte“. Seine Äußerungen deuten nicht auf ein liberal-, sondern erzkonservatives Weltbild hin. Die Personalie Weimer ist daher umstritten. Die Kulturwelt wird sich nach Claudia Roth (Grüne) und der Merkel-Vertrauten Monika Grütters (CDU) als Kulturstaatsministerinnen erst an den konservativen Weimer gewöhnen müssen. Weimer bringt zudem ein doppeltes Manko mit: Der Publizist hat weder Erfahrung in der Politik noch sind Kontakte in die Kulturwelt bekannt. Gleichzeitig steht er vor der Aufgabe, die Kulturwelt sowie Geld und Mehrheiten für die Kultur zu organisieren.

Nach dem Jurastudium in Bonn hat Schnieder zunächst als Rechtsanwalt gearbeitet, bevor er 1998 zum Bürgermeister der Verbandsgemeinde Arzfeld gewählt wurde. 2009 zog der heute 56-Jährige erstmals als direkt gewählter Abgeordneter in den Bundestag ein. In der vergangenen Legislaturperiode war der Jurist stellvertretendes Mitglied im Verkehrsausschuss und als Parlamentarischer Geschäftsführer der CDU/CSU-Bundestagsfraktion Mitglied des Führungskreises um Fraktionschef Merz. Schnieder erwarten große Aufgaben: In seiner künftigen Position wird er eine Schlüsselrolle bei der Umsetzung des Sondervermögens für Infrastruktur spielen. Mit einem großen Teil der 500 Milliarden Euro sollen marode Brücken und das Schienennetz saniert werden. Ministerin für Gesundheit: Nina Warken (CDU) Nina Warken (CDU) spricht bei einer Pressekonferenz über die Ergebnisse des Treffens der Südwest-CDU im Kloster Schöntal. Die CDU-Bundestagsabgeordnete Nina Warken soll neue Gesundheitsministerin werden. (picture alliance / dpa / Christoph Schmidt) Diese Personalie war ebenfalls überraschend: Die öffentlich eher unbekannte CDU-Bundestagsabgeordnete Nina Warken soll Bundesgesundheitsministerin werden. Die Rechtsanwältin aus Baden-Württemberg war an den Koalitionsverhandlungen noch in der Arbeitsgruppe Inneres, Recht und Migration beteiligt, Gesundheitspolitik war bisher nicht ihr Schwerpunkt. Im Bundestag saß die Parlamentarische Geschäftsführerin der Unionsfraktion auch im Ältestenrat, zudem ist die 45-Jährige im Bundesvorstand der Frauenunion. Der Politikwissenschaftler Thorsten Faas deutet diese Personalentscheidung „auch in einer Proporzlogik des Regionalen“: Der Landesverband Baden-Württemberg habe früh sehr loyal zu Friedrich Merz gestanden. Der zukünftige Bundeskanzler habe kein riesiges Netzwerk, nachdem er jahrelang außerhalb der Politik war.

Karin Prien gilt als eine der profiliertesten Bildungspolitikerinnen in der Union. (picture alliance / dpa / Michael Kappeler) Als Ressortchefin für Bildung und Familie ist die schleswig-holsteinische Bildungsministerin Karin Prien vorgesehen. Ihre Familie war vor den Nazis in die Niederlande geflohen, Prien und ihr jüngerer Bruder kamen in Amsterdam zur Welt. Die meinungsstarke und debattenfreudige Juristin lebt in Hamburg und gilt als eine der profiliertesten Bildungspolitikerinnen in der Union. Karin Prien ist bereits seit 1981 CDU-Mitglied und hat sich schon als Bürgerschaftsabgeordnete in Hamburg für Bildungsthemen engagiert. Seit 2017 ist sie in Schleswig-Holstein Ministerin für Bildung, Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kultur.

Mit 47 Jahren ist sie die jüngste der drei für Ministerämter vorgesehenen CSU-Politikerinnen und -Politiker. Dorothee Bär hat seit 2002 Erfahrung im Bundestag und bringt viel Erfahrung im Bereich Hightech mit: Von 2013 bis 2018 war die gebürtige Bambergerin Staatssekretärin beim Bundesministerium für Verkehr und digitale Infrastruktur, von 2018 bis 2021 Staatsministerin im Bundeskanzleramt und Beauftragte der Bundesregierung für Digitalisierung.

Mit Alois Rainer (CSU) übernimmt ein gelernter Metzger aus Niederbayern das Landwirtschaftsministerium. (picture alliance / dpa / Peter Kneffel) Als weitere Überraschung gilt die Entscheidung für den niederbayerischen Bundestagsabgeordneten Alois Rainer als Bundeslandwirtschaftsminister. Der Metzgermeister aus Straubing in Niederbayern hat noch immer einen Betrieb zusammen mit seinem Sohn. Alois Rainer ist politisch hervorragend vernetzt, seine Schwester ist die ehemalige CSU-Bundesministerin Gerda Hasselfeldt. Sein Vater war Landtags- und Bundestagsabgeordneter. Für die CSU passt der Niederbayer perfekt ins Landwirtschaftsministerium: Er verkörpert das Thema Heimat und gilt als äußerst bodenständig.

Eine umstrittene Personalie: Der parteilose Publizist und Verleger Wolfram Weimer soll Kulturstaatsminister werden. (picture alliance / HMB Media / Uwe Koch) Eine besondere Rolle hat der Beauftragte der Bundesregierung für Kultur und Medien, auch bekannt als Kulturstaatsminister. Dieser Posten ist kein Ministeramt, der Staatsminister hat daher kein Abstimmungsrecht, er sitzt aber mit am Kabinettstisch. Viele Namen wurden im Vorfeld für das Amt gehandelt. Übernehmen soll es nun der Publizist und Verleger Wolfram Weimer. Der 60-Jährige war Chefredakteur von „Welt“ und „Focus“ und gründete das Magazin „Cicero“. Er gilt als CDU-nah, hat aber kein Parteibuch. Weimer und Merz haben auch eine persönliche Verbindung, kennen sich aus dem sehr wohlhabenden Kosmos am oberbayerischen Tegernsee und sind zusammen Golfen gegangen.

Zwischen ihnen steht die CDU-Parteivorsitzender, Nina Warken, designierte Bundesministerin für Gesundheit. KommentarWolfram Weimer muss das Vertrauen in die Kulturwelt bewahren 03:17 Minuten28.04.2025 Der Publizist Weimer steht für soliden Journalismus, aber auch für polarisierende Publizistik: Auf dem Höhepunkt der Migrationsdebatte schrieb er etwa im „Cicero“ von der „Multikulti-Lüge“, sein Buch „Das konservative Manifest“ beschrieb er selbst als „Gift für Linke und eine Zumutung für Rechte“. Seine Äußerungen deuten nicht auf ein liberal-, sondern erzkonservatives Weltbild hin. Die Personalie Weimer ist daher umstritten. Die Kulturwelt wird sich nach Claudia Roth (Grüne) und der Merkel-Vertrauten Monika Grütters (CDU) als Kulturstaatsministerinnen erst an den konservativen Weimer gewöhnen müssen. Weimer bringt zudem ein doppeltes Manko mit: Der Publizist hat weder Erfahrung in der Politik noch sind Kontakte in die Kulturwelt bekannt. Gleichzeitig steht er vor der Aufgabe, die Kulturwelt sowie Geld und Mehrheiten für die Kultur zu organisieren.

Schenderlein ist zwar mit dem Thema Ehrenamt vertraut, sportpolitisch bislang aber nicht in Erscheinung getreten. Die 43-jährige promovierte Philosophin war Experten und Sportfunktionären bisher eher unbekannt. Thomas Weikert, Präsident des Deutschen Olympischen Sportbundes, zeigte sich darüber erfreut, dass das Amt überhaupt eingerichtet wurde. Die deutsche Sportwelt erhofft sich von dem neu geschaffenen Posten, dass der Sport näher an den Kabinettstisch rückt.

Trotz des historisch schlechtesten Ergebnisses für die SPD bei der Bundestagswahl wurde der 47-Jährige seit Februar zur zentralen Figur der Partei und sicherte sich auch den Fraktionsvorsitz. Diesen muss er bei einem Eintritt ins Kabinett allerdings wieder abgeben. Klingbeil wurde in Soltau geboren und wuchs im benachbarten Munster auf, einer Kleinstadt mit einem der größten Bundeswehrstandorte Deutschlands. Ende 2017 wurde er zum SPD-Generalsekretär. Sein damals größter Erfolg war der Bundestagswahlkampf 2021, an dessen Ende die SPD mit Olaf Scholz als Spitzenkandidat wider Erwarten stärkste Kraft wurde.

Thorsten Frei (CDU), bisher erster parlamentarischer Geschäftsführer der Unionsfraktion im Bundestag, soll Kanzleramtsminister werden. (picture alliance / dpa / Bernd von Jutrczenka) Mit Thorsten Frei soll einer der engsten Vertrauten von Friedrich Merz zum Kanzleramtschef werden. Frei sitze damit an „absolut zentraler Position“, betont der Politikwissenschaftler Thorsten Faas. Der erste parlamentarische Geschäftsführer der Unionsfraktion im Bundestag kommt aus Baden-Württemberg. Dort hat der Jurist auch das politische Handwerk gelernt. Von 2002 bis 2004 war er Regierungsrat im Staatsministerium Baden-Württemberg, von 2004 bis 2013 Oberbürgermeister von Donaueschingen. Seit 2013 sitzt der 52-Jährige im Bundestag. Thorsten Frei sorgte 2013 für Aufregung mit seiner Forderung, das Individualrecht auf Asyl abzuschaffen und durch eine Kontingentlösung zu ersetzen. Bisher ist der CDU-Politiker häufig zu Gast in Talkshows. Im Kanzleramt wird sein Job eher hinter den Kulissen sein. Dort wird seine Aufgabe sein, für Merz Fallstricke aus dem Weg räumen, einen reibungslosen Regierungsablauf zu sichern und Kontakt zu den Bundesländern zu halten.

Mit dem künftigen Bundeskanzler Friedrich Merz teilt sie die Erfahrung einer längeren Auszeit von der aktiven Politik. Reiche zog schon mit 25 Jahren für die CDU in den Bundestag ein. Bis 2015 war sie Abgeordnete und Parlamentarische Staatssekretärin im Umwelt- und später im Verkehrsministerium, bis sie in die Wirtschaft wechselte. Dort war die gebürtige Brandenburgerin zunächst beim Verband kommunaler Unternehmen tätig, der viele Stadtwerke vertritt. 2020 kam die heute 51-Jährige zur E.ON-Tochter Westenergie.

(picture alliance / dpa / Revierfoto / Revierfoto) Politisch viel Gewicht bringt Alexander Dobrindt in das Kabinett ein. Für das Bundesinnenministerium hat die CSU ihren langjährigen Landesgruppenchef nominiert. In dieser Position, die Dobrindt seit 2017 innehat, war er intern unumstritten. Als Bundesverkehrsminister (2013-2017) hat er eine gemischte Bilanz hinterlassen: Auf sein Konto geht beispielsweise die gescheiterte „Ausländermaut“.

CSUDobrindt soll neuer Bundesinnenminister werden 04:14 Minuten28.04.2025 Dobrindt steht für einen sehr konservativen Kurs und „Law and Order“-Politik. Er durfte sich offenbar sein Ministerium aussuchen und entschied sich mit dem Innenministerium für einen Posten, der zentral für die Union und die gesamte Bundesregierung ist. Er muss die Versprechen in der Sicherheits- und Asylpolitik umsetzen, die CDU/CSU im Wahlkampf gegeben haben.

Der Jurist und ehemalige Zeitsoldat ist seit 2009 Mitglied des Bundestages und gilt als Vertrauter von Friedrich Merz. Wadephul ist stellvertretender Vorsitzender der CDU/CSU-Bundestagsfraktion. Dort ist er zuständig für die Bereiche Auswärtiges, Verteidigung und die Interparlamentarische Konferenz für die Gemeinsame Außen- und Sicherheitspolitik (GASP) und die Gemeinsame Sicherheits- und Verteidigungspolitik (GSVP) und Europarat. Seit November 2024 ist Wadephul Vizepräsident der parlamentarischen Versammlung der NATO. Zuletzt besuchte er die Außenminister Frankreichs, Polens, Italiens und Großbritanniens.

Karsten Wildberger, Vorstandschef des Konzerns Ceconomy und Vorsitzender der Geschäftsführung der Media-Saturn-Holding, soll das Amt im Kabinett von Friedrich Merz übernehmen. Im Laufe seiner Karriere hat der promovierte Physiker internationale Führungspositionen unter anderem bei T-Mobile, Vodafone und dem australischen Telekommunikationsunternehmen Telstar bekleidet.

(picture alliance / dpa / Bernd von Jutrczenka) Mit Thorsten Frei soll einer der engsten Vertrauten von Friedrich Merz zum Kanzleramtschef werden. Frei sitze damit an „absolut zentraler Position“, betont der Politikwissenschaftler Thorsten Faas. Der erste parlamentarische Geschäftsführer der Unionsfraktion im Bundestag kommt aus Baden-Württemberg. Dort hat der Jurist auch das politische Handwerk gelernt. Von 2002 bis 2004 war er Regierungsrat im Staatsministerium Baden-Württemberg, von 2004 bis 2013 Oberbürgermeister von Donaueschingen. Seit 2013 sitzt der 52-Jährige im Bundestag. Thorsten Frei sorgte 2013 für Aufregung mit seiner Forderung, das Individualrecht auf Asyl abzuschaffen und durch eine Kontingentlösung zu ersetzen. Bisher ist der CDU-Politiker häufig zu Gast in Talkshows. Im Kanzleramt wird sein Job eher hinter den Kulissen sein. Dort wird seine Aufgabe sein, für Merz Fallstricke aus dem Weg räumen, einen reibungslosen Regierungsablauf zu sichern und Kontakt zu den Bundesländern zu halten.

Mit dem künftigen Bundeskanzler Friedrich Merz teilt sie die Erfahrung einer längeren Auszeit von der aktiven Politik. Reiche zog schon mit 25 Jahren für die CDU in den Bundestag ein. Bis 2015 war sie Abgeordnete und Parlamentarische Staatssekretärin im Umwelt- und später im Verkehrsministerium, bis sie in die Wirtschaft wechselte. Dort war die gebürtige Brandenburgerin zunächst beim Verband kommunaler Unternehmen tätig, der viele Stadtwerke vertritt. 2020 kam die heute 51-Jährige zur E.ON-Tochter Westenergie. Minister für Inneres: Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) Alexander Dobrindt, Vorsitzender der CSU-Landesgruppe, nach der Sitzung des CSU-Vorstands am 28.04.2025 in München Der zukünftige Bundesinnenminister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) gilt als konservativer „Law and Order“-Politiker.

Für das Bundesinnenministerium hat die CSU ihren langjährigen Landesgruppenchef nominiert. In dieser Position, die Dobrindt seit 2017 innehat, war er intern unumstritten. Als Bundesverkehrsminister (2013-2017) hat er eine gemischte Bilanz hinterlassen: Auf sein Konto geht beispielsweise die gescheiterte „Ausländermaut“.

Der Jurist und ehemalige Zeitsoldat ist seit 2009 Mitglied des Bundestages und gilt als Vertrauter von Friedrich Merz. Wadephul ist stellvertretender Vorsitzender der CDU/CSU-Bundestagsfraktion. Dort ist er zuständig für die Bereiche Auswärtiges, Verteidigung und die Interparlamentarische Konferenz für die Gemeinsame Außen- und Sicherheitspolitik (GASP) und die Gemeinsame Sicherheits- und Verteidigungspolitik (GSVP) und Europarat.

Karsten Wildberger, Vorstandschef des Konzerns Ceconomy und Vorsitzender der Geschäftsführung der Media-Saturn-Holding, soll das Amt im Kabinett von Friedrich Merz übernehmen. Im Laufe seiner Karriere hat der promovierte Physiker internationale Führungspositionen unter anderem bei T-Mobile, Vodafone und dem australischen Telekommunikationsunternehmen Telstar bekleidet.

(picture alliance / Jörg Carstensen / Joerg Carstensen) Das Verkehrsressort wird mit dem CDU-Bundestagsabgeordneten Patrick Schnieder ein erfahrener Parlamentarier aus Rheinland-Pfalz übernehmen. Nach dem Jurastudium in Bonn hat Schnieder zunächst als Rechtsanwalt gearbeitet, bevor er 1998 zum Bürgermeister der Verbandsgemeinde Arzfeld gewählt wurde. 2009 zog der heute 56-Jährige erstmals als direkt gewählter Abgeordneter in den Bundestag ein. In der vergangenen Legislaturperiode war der Jurist stellvertretendes Mitglied im Verkehrsausschuss und als Parlamentarischer Geschäftsführer der CDU/CSU-Bundestagsfraktion Mitglied des Führungskreises um Fraktionschef Merz. Schnieder erwarten große Aufgaben: In seiner künftigen Position wird er eine Schlüsselrolle bei der Umsetzung des Sondervermögens für Infrastruktur spielen. Mit einem großen Teil der 500 Milliarden Euro sollen marode Brücken und das Schienennetz saniert werden.

Die CDU-Bundestagsabgeordnete Nina Warken soll neue Gesundheitsministerin werden. (picture alliance / dpa / Christoph Schmidt) Diese Personalie war ebenfalls überraschend: Die öffentlich eher unbekannte CDU-Bundestagsabgeordnete Nina Warken soll Bundesgesundheitsministerin werden. Die Rechtsanwältin aus Baden-Württemberg war an den Koalitionsverhandlungen noch in der Arbeitsgruppe Inneres, Recht und Migration beteiligt, Gesundheitspolitik war bisher nicht ihr Schwerpunkt. Im Bundestag saß die Parlamentarische Geschäftsführerin der Unionsfraktion auch im Ältestenrat, zudem ist die 45-Jährige im Bundesvorstand der Frauenunion. Der Politikwissenschaftler Thorsten Faas deutet diese Personalentscheidung „auch in einer Proporzlogik des Regionalen“: Der Landesverband Baden-Württemberg habe früh sehr loyal zu Friedrich Merz gestanden. Der zukünftige Bundeskanzler habe kein riesiges Netzwerk, nachdem er jahrelang außerhalb der Politik war.

Ihre Familie war vor den Nazis in die Niederlande geflohen, Prien und ihr jüngerer Bruder kamen in Amsterdam zur Welt. Die meinungsstarke und debattenfreudige Juristin lebt in Hamburg und gilt als eine der profiliertesten Bildungspolitikerinnen in der Union.

Mit 47 Jahren ist sie die jüngste der drei für Ministerämter vorgesehenen CSU-Politikerinnen und -Politiker. Dorothee Bär hat seit 2002 Erfahrung im Bundestag und bringt viel Erfahrung im Bereich Hightech mit: Von 2013 bis 2018 war die gebürtige Bambergerin Staatssekretärin beim Bundesministerium für Verkehr und digitale Infrastruktur, von 2018 bis 2021 Staatsministerin im Bundeskanzleramt und Beauftragte der Bundesregierung für Digitalisierung.

(picture alliance / dpa / Peter Kneffel) Als weitere Überraschung gilt die Entscheidung für den niederbayerischen Bundestagsabgeordneten Alois Rainer als Bundeslandwirtschaftsminister. Der Metzgermeister aus Straubing in Niederbayern hat noch immer einen Betrieb zusammen mit seinem Sohn. Alois Rainer ist politisch hervorragend vernetzt, seine Schwester ist die ehemalige CSU-Bundesministerin Gerda Hasselfeldt. Sein Vater war Landtags- und Bundestagsabgeordneter. Für die CSU passt der Niederbayer perfekt ins Landwirtschaftsministerium: Er verkörpert das Thema Heimat und gilt als äußerst bodenständig.

Eine umstrittene Personalie: Der parteilose Publizist und Verleger Wolfram Weimer soll Kulturstaatsminister werden. (picture alliance / HMB Media / Uwe Koch) Eine besondere Rolle hat der Beauftragte der Bundesregierung für Kultur und Medien, auch bekannt als Kulturstaatsminister. Dieser Posten ist kein Ministeramt, der Staatsminister hat daher kein Abstimmungsrecht, er sitzt aber mit am Kabinettstisch. Viele Namen wurden im Vorfeld für das Amt gehandelt. Übernehmen soll es nun der Publizist und Verleger Wolfram Weimer. Der 60-Jährige war Chefredakteur von „Welt“ und „Focus“ und gründete das Magazin „Cicero“. Er gilt als CDU-nah, hat aber kein Parteibuch. Weimer und Merz haben auch eine persönliche Verbindung, kennen sich aus dem sehr wohlhabenden Kosmos am oberbayerischen Tegernsee und sind zusammen Golfen gegangen. Wolfram Weimer, designierter Staatsminister für Kultur und Medien Wolfram WeimerEin konservativer Quereinsteiger wird Kulturstaatsminister Friedrich Merz schüttelt Wolfram Weimer die Hand. Zwischen ihnen steht die CDU-Parteivorsitzender, Nina Warken, designierte Bundesministerin für Gesundheit. KommentarWolfram Weimer muss das Vertrauen in die Kulturwelt bewahren 03:17 Minuten28.04.2025 Der Publizist Weimer steht für soliden Journalismus, aber auch für polarisierende Publizistik: Auf dem Höhepunkt der Migrationsdebatte schrieb er etwa im „Cicero“ von der „Multikulti-Lüge“, sein Buch „Das konservative Manifest“ beschrieb er selbst als „Gift für Linke und eine Zumutung für Rechte“. Seine Äußerungen deuten nicht auf ein liberal-, sondern erzkonservatives Weltbild hin. Die Personalie Weimer ist daher umstritten. Die Kulturwelt wird sich nach Claudia Roth (Grüne) und der Merkel-Vertrauten Monika Grütters (CDU) als Kulturstaatsministerinnen erst an den konservativen Weimer gewöhnen müssen. Weimer bringt zudem ein doppeltes Manko mit: Der Publizist hat weder Erfahrung in der Politik noch sind Kontakte in die Kulturwelt bekannt. Gleichzeitig steht er vor der Aufgabe, die Kulturwelt sowie Geld und Mehrheiten für die Kultur zu organisieren.

Die Entscheidung für Christiane Schenderlein aus Nordsachsen ist eine weitere Überraschung. Schenderlein ist zwar mit dem Thema Ehrenamt vertraut, sportpolitisch bislang aber nicht in Erscheinung getreten. Die 43-jährige promovierte Philosophin war Experten und Sportfunktionären bisher eher unbekannt. Thomas Weikert, Präsident des Deutschen Olympischen Sportbundes, zeigte sich darüber erfreut, dass das Amt überhaupt eingerichtet wurde. Die deutsche Sportwelt erhofft sich von dem neu geschaffenen Posten, dass der Sport näher an den Kabinettstisch rückt. Außerdem freut man sich über die Bündelung der bislang auf verschiedene Ressorts verteilten Sportthemen an einer zentralen Ansprechstelle direkt im Kanzleramt.

Dafür sprach sich das Präsidium der Sozialdemokraten am 30.04.2025 aus. Trotz des historisch schlechtesten Ergebnisses für die SPD bei der Bundestagswahl wurde der 47-Jährige seit Februar zur zentralen Figur der Partei und sicherte sich auch den Fraktionsvorsitz. Diesen muss er bei einem Eintritt ins Kabinett allerdings wieder abgeben. Klingbeil wurde in Soltau geboren und wuchs im benachbarten Munster auf, einer Kleinstadt mit einem der größten Bundeswehrstandorte Deutschlands. Ende 2017 wurde er zum SPD-Generalsekretär. Sein damals größter Erfolg war der Bundestagswahlkampf 2021, an dessen Ende die SPD mit Olaf Scholz als Spitzenkandidat wider Erwarten stärkste Kraft wurde. Im Dezember 2021 übernahm er den Parteivorsitz als Nachfolger von Norbert Walter-Borjans.

Die Kulturwelt wird sich nach Claudia Roth (Grüne) und der Merkel-Vertrauten Monika Grütters (CDU) als Kulturstaatsministerinnen erst an den konservativen Weimer gewöhnen müssen. Weimer bringt zudem ein doppeltes Manko mit: Der Publizist hat weder Erfahrung in der Politik noch sind Kontakte in die Kulturwelt bekannt. Gleichzeitig steht er vor der Aufgabe, die Kulturwelt sowie Geld und Mehrheiten für die Kultur zu organisieren.

(picture alliance / dpa / Michael Kappeler) Erstmals wird es in der neuen Bundesregierung eine Staatsministerin für Sport und Ehrenamt geben. Die Entscheidung für Christiane Schenderlein aus Nordsachsen ist eine weitere Überraschung. Schenderlein ist zwar mit dem Thema Ehrenamt vertraut, sportpolitisch bislang aber nicht in Erscheinung getreten. Die 43-jährige promovierte Philosophin war Experten und Sportfunktionären bisher eher unbekannt. Thomas Weikert, Präsident des Deutschen Olympischen Sportbundes, zeigte sich darüber erfreut, dass das Amt überhaupt eingerichtet wurde. Die deutsche Sportwelt erhofft sich von dem neu geschaffenen Posten, dass der Sport näher an den Kabinettstisch rückt. Außerdem freut man sich über die Bündelung der bislang auf verschiedene Ressorts verteilten Sportthemen an einer zentralen Ansprechstelle direkt im Kanzleramt.

Dafür sprach sich das Präsidium der Sozialdemokraten am 30.04.2025 aus. Trotz des historisch schlechtesten Ergebnisses für die SPD bei der Bundestagswahl wurde der 47-Jährige seit Februar zur zentralen Figur der Partei und sicherte sich auch den Fraktionsvorsitz. Diesen muss er bei einem Eintritt ins Kabinett allerdings wieder abgeben. Klingbeil wurde in Soltau geboren und wuchs im benachbarten Munster auf, einer Kleinstadt mit einem der größten Bundeswehrstandorte Deutschlands. Ende 2017 wurde er zum SPD-Generalsekretär. Sein damals größter Erfolg war der Bundestagswahlkampf 2021, an dessen Ende die SPD mit Olaf Scholz als Spitzenkandidat wider Erwarten stärkste Kraft wurde.

In der SPD gehört er aber zum eher konservativen Seeheimer Kreis. Als Finanzminister will er nun das Sondervermögen Infrastruktur vorantreiben und umsetzen, heißt es in einem Schreiben von Klingbeil an die SPD-Bundestagsfraktion, über den als erstes die „Rheinische Post“ berichtete. Bis zum 05. Mai sollen die weiteren fünf Ministerposten der SPD bekannt geben werden. Dazu zählen: Verteidigung, Arbeit und Soziales, Justiz und Verbraucherschutz, Umwelt, Klimaschutz, Naturschutz und nukleare Sicherheit, Wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung und Wohnen, Stadtentwicklung und Bauwesen. Kanzleramtsminister: Thorsten Frei (CDU) Thorsten Frei (CDU) kommt strahlend zur Sitzung vom Bundesvorstand der CDU im Konrad-Adenauer-Haus. Thorsten Frei (CDU), bisher erster parlamentarischer Geschäftsführer der Unionsfraktion im Bundestag, soll Kanzleramtsminister werden. (picture alliance / dpa / Bernd von Jutrczenka) Mit Thorsten Frei soll einer der engsten Vertrauten von Friedrich Merz zum Kanzleramtschef werden. Frei sitze damit an „absolut zentraler Position“, betont der Politikwissenschaftler Thorsten Faas. Der erste parlamentarische Geschäftsführer der Unionsfraktion im Bundestag kommt aus Baden-Württemberg. Dort hat der Jurist auch das politische Handwerk gelernt. Von 2002 bis 2004 war er Regierungsrat im Staatsministerium Baden-Württemberg, von 2004 bis 2013 Oberbürgermeister von Donaueschingen. Seit 2013 sitzt der 52-Jährige im Bundestag. Thorsten Frei sorgte 2013 für Aufregung mit seiner Forderung, das Individualrecht auf Asyl abzuschaffen und durch eine Kontingentlösung zu ersetzen. Bisher ist der CDU-Politiker häufig zu Gast in Talkshows. Im Kanzleramt wird sein Job eher hinter den Kulissen sein. Dort wird seine Aufgabe sein, für Merz Fallstricke aus dem Weg räumen, einen reibungslosen Regierungsablauf zu sichern und Kontakt zu den Bundesländern zu halten.

(picture alliance / dpa / Kay Nietfeld) Von der Vorstandsvorsitzenden des Energieversorgers Westenergie an die Spitze des Wirtschaftsministeriums: Die Nominierung der Diplomchemikerin Katherina Reiche ist eine Überraschung. Mit dem künftigen Bundeskanzler Friedrich Merz teilt sie die Erfahrung einer längeren Auszeit von der aktiven Politik. Reiche zog schon mit 25 Jahren für die CDU in den Bundestag ein. Bis 2015 war sie Abgeordnete und Parlamentarische Staatssekretärin im Umwelt- und später im Verkehrsministerium, bis sie in die Wirtschaft wechselte. Dort war die gebürtige Brandenburgerin zunächst beim Verband kommunaler Unternehmen tätig, der viele Stadtwerke vertritt. 2020 kam die heute 51-Jährige zur E.ON-Tochter Westenergie. Minister für Inneres: Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) Alexander Dobrindt, Vorsitzender der CSU-Landesgruppe, nach der Sitzung des CSU-Vorstands am 28.04.2025 in München Der zukünftige Bundesinnenminister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) gilt als konservativer „Law and Order“-Politiker. (picture alliance / dpa / Revierfoto / Revierfoto) Politisch viel Gewicht bringt Alexander Dobrindt in das Kabinett ein. Für das Bundesinnenministerium hat die CSU ihren langjährigen Landesgruppenchef nominiert. In dieser Position, die Dobrindt seit 2017 innehat, war er intern unumstritten. Als Bundesverkehrsminister (2013-2017) hat er eine gemischte Bilanz hinterlassen: Auf sein Konto geht beispielsweise die gescheiterte „Ausländermaut“. Der designierte Bundesinnenminister Alexander Dobrindt steht im Innenhof der CSU-Parteizentrale neben dem CSU-Logo. CSUDobrindt soll neuer Bundesinnenminister werden 04:14 Minuten28.04.2025 Dobrindt steht für einen sehr konservativen Kurs und „Law and Order“-Politik. Er durfte sich offenbar sein Ministerium aussuchen und entschied sich mit dem Innenministerium für einen Posten, der zentral für die Union und die gesamte Bundesregierung ist. Er muss die Versprechen in der Sicherheits- und Asylpolitik umsetzen, die CDU/CSU im Wahlkampf gegeben haben. Auswärtiges Amt: Johann Wadephul (CDU) Johann Wadephul (CDU) steht am Rande einer Pressekonferenz der Parteivorsitzenden von Union und SPD zur Vorstellung des Koalitionsvertrages im Paul-Löbe-Haus. Mit Johann Wadephul (CDU) wird ein profilierter Außen- und Sicherheitspolitikexperte der neue Chef im Auswärtigen Amt. (picture alliance / dpa / Michael Kappeler) Das Außenministerium geht nach fast 60 Jahren erstmals wieder an die CDU. Leiten soll es der Außen- und Sicherheitsexperte Johann Wadephul aus Schleswig-Holstein. Der Jurist und ehemalige Zeitsoldat ist seit 2009 Mitglied des Bundestages und gilt als Vertrauter von Friedrich Merz. Wadephul ist stellvertretender Vorsitzender der CDU/CSU-Bundestagsfraktion. Dort ist er zuständig für die Bereiche Auswärtiges, Verteidigung und die Interparlamentarische Konferenz für die Gemeinsame Außen- und Sicherheitspolitik (GASP) und die Gemeinsame Sicherheits- und Verteidigungspolitik (GSVP) und Europarat. Seit November 2024 ist Wadephul Vizepräsident der parlamentarischen Versammlung der NATO. Zuletzt besuchte er die Außenminister Frankreichs, Polens, Italiens und Großbritanniens. Digitalisierung und Staatsmodernisierung: Karsten Wildberger (parteilos) Porträt von Karsten Wildberger, designierter Bundesminister für Digitalisierung und Staatsmodernisierung. Er blickt direkt in die Kamera. Vom CEO zum Digitalisierungsminister: Mit Karsten Wildberger kommt ein Topmanager aus der Wirtschaft ins Kabinett. (picture alliance / dpa / Kay Nietfeld) Eine Überraschung ist die Besetzung des neu geschaffenen Ressorts für Digitalisierung und Staatsmodernisierung. Karsten Wildberger, Vorstandschef des Konzerns Ceconomy und Vorsitzender der Geschäftsführung der Media-Saturn-Holding, soll das Amt im Kabinett von Friedrich Merz übernehmen. Im Laufe seiner Karriere hat der promovierte Physiker internationale Führungspositionen unter anderem bei T-Mobile, Vodafone und dem australischen Telekommunikationsunternehmen Telstar bekleidet. Dlf Audiothek Karsten WildbergerWer ist der CEO und zukünftige Digitalminister? 01:30 Minuten28.04.2025 Die digitale Transformation in Wirtschaft und Unternehmenswelt gehörte in den vergangenen Jahren zum Kern seiner Tätigkeiten. Nach Bekanntgabe seiner Berufung bat Wildberger den Ceconomy-Aufsichtsrat darum, ihn zum 5. Mai von seinen Aufgaben zu entbinden. Unter seiner Führung hatte Ceconomy als Elektronikmärkte-Betreiber das Onlinegeschäft ausgebaut. Der Aktienkurs ist seit Amtsantritt von Wildberger im August 2021 allerdings um gut 20 Prozent geschrumpft. Verkehr: Patrick Schnieder (CDU) Patrick Schnieder (CDU), zukünftiger Bundesminister für Verkehr, kommt zur Sitzung des CDU-Bundesausschusses ins Estrel Hotel. Er schaut direkt in die Kamera. Als künftiger Verkehrsminister wird Patrick Schnieder (CDU) die Aufgabe zukommen, marode Schienen und Brücken zu sanieren. (picture alliance / Jörg Carstensen / Joerg Carstensen) Das Verkehrsressort wird mit dem CDU-Bundestagsabgeordneten Patrick Schnieder ein erfahrener Parlamentarier aus Rheinland-Pfalz übernehmen. Nach dem Jurastudium in Bonn hat Schnieder zunächst als Rechtsanwalt gearbeitet, bevor er 1998 zum Bürgermeister der Verbandsgemeinde Arzfeld gewählt wurde. 2009 zog der heute 56-Jährige erstmals als direkt gewählter Abgeordneter in den Bundestag ein. In der vergangenen Legislaturperiode war der Jurist stellvertretendes Mitglied im Verkehrsausschuss und als Parlamentarischer Geschäftsführer der CDU/CSU-Bundestagsfraktion Mitglied des Führungskreises um Fraktionschef Merz. Schnieder erwarten große Aufgaben: In seiner künftigen Position wird er eine Schlüsselrolle bei der Umsetzung des Sondervermögens für Infrastruktur spielen. Mit einem großen Teil der 500 Milliarden Euro sollen marode Brücken und das Schienennetz saniert werden. Ministerin für Gesundheit: Nina Warken (CDU) Nina Warken (CDU) spricht bei einer Pressekonferenz über die Ergebnisse des Treffens der Südwest-CDU im Kloster Schöntal. Die CDU-Bundestagsabgeordnete Nina Warken soll neue Gesundheitsministerin werden. (picture alliance / dpa / Christoph Schmidt) Diese Personalie war ebenfalls überraschend: Die öffentlich eher unbekannte CDU-Bundestagsabgeordnete Nina Warken soll Bundesgesundheitsministerin werden. Die Rechtsanwältin aus Baden-Württemberg war an den Koalitionsverhandlungen noch in der Arbeitsgruppe Inneres, Recht und Migration beteiligt, Gesundheitspolitik war bisher nicht ihr Schwerpunkt. Im Bundestag saß die Parlamentarische Geschäftsführerin der Unionsfraktion auch im Ältestenrat, zudem ist die 45-Jährige im Bundesvorstand der Frauenunion. Der Politikwissenschaftler Thorsten Faas deutet diese Personalentscheidung „auch in einer Proporzlogik des Regionalen“: Der Landesverband Baden-Württemberg habe früh sehr loyal zu Friedrich Merz gestanden. Der zukünftige Bundeskanzler habe kein riesiges Netzwerk, nachdem er jahrelang außerhalb der Politik war. Bildung und Familie: Karin Prien (CDU) Karin Prien (CDU), designierte Bundesministerin für Bildung, Familie, Senioren, Frauen und Jugend, aufgenommen beim Bundesausschuss der CDU. Karin Prien gilt als eine der profiliertesten Bildungspolitikerinnen in der Union. (picture alliance / dpa / Michael Kappeler) Als Ressortchefin für Bildung und Familie ist die schleswig-holsteinische Bildungsministerin Karin Prien vorgesehen. Ihre Familie war vor den Nazis in die Niederlande geflohen, Prien und ihr jüngerer Bruder kamen in Amsterdam zur Welt. Die meinungsstarke und debattenfreudige Juristin lebt in Hamburg und gilt als eine der profiliertesten Bildungspolitikerinnen in der Union. Karin Prien ist bereits seit 1981 CDU-Mitglied und hat sich schon als Bürgerschaftsabgeordnete in Hamburg für Bildungsthemen engagiert. Seit 2017 ist sie in Schleswig-Holstein Ministerin für Bildung, Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kultur. Forschung und Raumfahrt: Dorothee Bär (CSU) Politikerin Dorothee Bär, stellvertretende Parteivorsitzende der CSU, zu Gast in der ARD-Talkshow ""Hart aber Fair"" Die stellvertretende CSU-Vorsitzende Dorothee Bär soll im künftigen Kabinett das Forschungs- und Raumfahrtministerium leiten. (picture alliance / dpa / Horst Galuschka) In der CSU genießt Dorothee Bär den Respekt ihrer Parteigenossen und der Parteiführung: Markus Söder lobt sie als sehr durchsetzungsstark. Mit 47 Jahren ist sie die jüngste der drei für Ministerämter vorgesehenen CSU-Politikerinnen und -Politiker. Dorothee Bär hat seit 2002 Erfahrung im Bundestag und bringt viel Erfahrung im Bereich Hightech mit: Von 2013 bis 2018 war die gebürtige Bambergerin Staatssekretärin beim Bundesministerium für Verkehr und digitale Infrastruktur, von 2018 bis 2021 Staatsministerin im Bundeskanzleramt und Beauftragte der Bundesregierung für Digitalisierung. Landwirtschaft: Alois Rainer (CSU) Der designierte Bundeslandwirtschaftsminister Alois Rainer steht nach der CSU-Vorstandssitzung für ein Porträt im Innenhof der Parteizentrale. Mit Alois Rainer (CSU) übernimmt ein gelernter Metzger aus Niederbayern das Landwirtschaftsministerium. (picture alliance / dpa / Peter Kneffel) Als weitere Überraschung gilt die Entscheidung für den niederbayerischen Bundestagsabgeordneten Alois Rainer als Bundeslandwirtschaftsminister. Der Metzgermeister aus Straubing in Niederbayern hat noch immer einen Betrieb zusammen mit seinem Sohn. Alois Rainer ist politisch hervorragend vernetzt, seine Schwester ist die ehemalige CSU-Bundesministerin Gerda Hasselfeldt. Sein Vater war Landtags- und Bundestagsabgeordneter. Für die CSU passt der Niederbayer perfekt ins Landwirtschaftsministerium: Er verkörpert das Thema Heimat und gilt als äußerst bodenständig. Staatsminister für Kultur und Medien: Wolfram Weimer (parteilos) Porträt von Wolfram Weimer in einem Fernsehstudio. Er trägt Brille und lacht. Eine umstrittene Personalie: Der parteilose Publizist und Verleger Wolfram Weimer soll Kulturstaatsminister werden. (picture alliance / HMB Media / Uwe Koch) Eine besondere Rolle hat der Beauftragte der Bundesregierung für Kultur und Medien, auch bekannt als Kulturstaatsminister. Dieser Posten ist kein Ministeramt, der Staatsminister hat daher kein Abstimmungsrecht, er sitzt aber mit am Kabinettstisch. Viele Namen wurden im Vorfeld für das Amt gehandelt. Übernehmen soll es nun der Publizist und Verleger Wolfram Weimer. Der 60-Jährige war Chefredakteur von „Welt“ und „Focus“ und gründete das Magazin „Cicero“. Er gilt als CDU-nah, hat aber kein Parteibuch. Weimer und Merz haben auch eine persönliche Verbindung, kennen sich aus dem sehr wohlhabenden Kosmos am oberbayerischen Tegernsee und sind zusammen Golfen gegangen. Wolfram Weimer, designierter Staatsminister für Kultur und Medien Wolfram WeimerEin konservativer Quereinsteiger wird Kulturstaatsminister Friedrich Merz schüttelt Wolfram Weimer die Hand.

Nach dem Jurastudium in Bonn hat Schnieder zunächst als Rechtsanwalt gearbeitet, bevor er 1998 zum Bürgermeister der Verbandsgemeinde Arzfeld gewählt wurde. 2009 zog der heute 56-Jährige erstmals als direkt gewählter Abgeordneter in den Bundestag ein. In der vergangenen Legislaturperiode war der Jurist stellvertretendes Mitglied im Verkehrsausschuss und als Parlamentarischer Geschäftsführer der CDU/CSU-Bundestagsfraktion Mitglied des Führungskreises um Fraktionschef Merz. Schnieder erwarten große Aufgaben: In seiner künftigen Position wird er eine Schlüsselrolle bei der Umsetzung des Sondervermögens für Infrastruktur spielen. Mit einem großen Teil der 500 Milliarden Euro sollen marode Brücken und das Schienennetz saniert werden.

Die Rechtsanwältin aus Baden-Württemberg war an den Koalitionsverhandlungen noch in der Arbeitsgruppe Inneres, Recht und Migration beteiligt, Gesundheitspolitik war bisher nicht ihr Schwerpunkt. Im Bundestag saß die Parlamentarische Geschäftsführerin der Unionsfraktion auch im Ältestenrat, zudem ist die 45-Jährige im Bundesvorstand der Frauenunion. Der Politikwissenschaftler Thorsten Faas deutet diese Personalentscheidung „auch in einer Proporzlogik des Regionalen“: Der Landesverband Baden-Württemberg habe früh sehr loyal zu Friedrich Merz gestanden. Der zukünftige Bundeskanzler habe kein riesiges Netzwerk, nachdem er jahrelang außerhalb der Politik war.

Der Metzgermeister aus Straubing in Niederbayern hat noch immer einen Betrieb zusammen mit seinem Sohn. Alois Rainer ist politisch hervorragend vernetzt, seine Schwester ist die ehemalige CSU-Bundesministerin Gerda Hasselfeldt. Sein Vater war Landtags- und Bundestagsabgeordneter.

Seine Äußerungen deuten nicht auf ein liberal-, sondern erzkonservatives Weltbild hin. Die Personalie Weimer ist daher umstritten. Die Kulturwelt wird sich nach Claudia Roth (Grüne) und der Merkel-Vertrauten Monika Grütters (CDU) als Kulturstaatsministerinnen erst an den konservativen Weimer gewöhnen müssen. Weimer bringt zudem ein doppeltes Manko mit: Der Publizist hat weder Erfahrung in der Politik noch sind Kontakte in die Kulturwelt bekannt.

Dafür sprach sich das Präsidium der Sozialdemokraten am 30.04.2025 aus. Trotz des historisch schlechtesten Ergebnisses für die SPD bei der Bundestagswahl wurde der 47-Jährige seit Februar zur zentralen Figur der Partei und sicherte sich auch den Fraktionsvorsitz. Diesen muss er bei einem Eintritt ins Kabinett allerdings wieder abgeben. Klingbeil wurde in Soltau geboren und wuchs im benachbarten Munster auf, einer Kleinstadt mit einem der größten Bundeswehrstandorte Deutschlands. Ende 2017 wurde er zum SPD-Generalsekretär. Sein damals größter Erfolg war der Bundestagswahlkampf 2021, an dessen Ende die SPD mit Olaf Scholz als Spitzenkandidat wider Erwarten stärkste Kraft wurde. Im Dezember 2021 übernahm er den Parteivorsitz als Nachfolger von Norbert Walter-Borjans.

Als Finanzminister will er nun das Sondervermögen Infrastruktur vorantreiben und umsetzen, heißt es in einem Schreiben von Klingbeil an die SPD-Bundestagsfraktion, über den als erstes die „Rheinische Post“ berichtete. Bis zum 05. Mai sollen die weiteren fünf Ministerposten der SPD bekannt geben werden. Dazu zählen: Verteidigung, Arbeit und Soziales, Justiz und Verbraucherschutz, Umwelt, Klimaschutz, Naturschutz und nukleare Sicherheit, Wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung und Wohnen, Stadtentwicklung und Bauwesen.

(picture alliance / dpa / Bernd von Jutrczenka) Mit Thorsten Frei soll einer der engsten Vertrauten von Friedrich Merz zum Kanzleramtschef werden. Frei sitze damit an „absolut zentraler Position“, betont der Politikwissenschaftler Thorsten Faas. Der erste parlamentarische Geschäftsführer der Unionsfraktion im Bundestag kommt aus Baden-Württemberg. Dort hat der Jurist auch das politische Handwerk gelernt. Von 2002 bis 2004 war er Regierungsrat im Staatsministerium Baden-Württemberg, von 2004 bis 2013 Oberbürgermeister von Donaueschingen. Seit 2013 sitzt der 52-Jährige im Bundestag. Thorsten Frei sorgte 2013 für Aufregung mit seiner Forderung, das Individualrecht auf Asyl abzuschaffen und durch eine Kontingentlösung zu ersetzen. Bisher ist der CDU-Politiker häufig zu Gast in Talkshows. Im Kanzleramt wird sein Job eher hinter den Kulissen sein. Dort wird seine Aufgabe sein, für Merz Fallstricke aus dem Weg räumen, einen reibungslosen Regierungsablauf zu sichern und Kontakt zu den Bundesländern zu halten.

Mit dem künftigen Bundeskanzler Friedrich Merz teilt sie die Erfahrung einer längeren Auszeit von der aktiven Politik. Reiche zog schon mit 25 Jahren für die CDU in den Bundestag ein. Bis 2015 war sie Abgeordnete und Parlamentarische Staatssekretärin im Umwelt- und später im Verkehrsministerium, bis sie in die Wirtschaft wechselte. Dort war die gebürtige Brandenburgerin zunächst beim Verband kommunaler Unternehmen tätig, der viele Stadtwerke vertritt. 2020 kam die heute 51-Jährige zur E.ON-Tochter Westenergie.

Für das Bundesinnenministerium hat die CSU ihren langjährigen Landesgruppenchef nominiert. In dieser Position, die Dobrindt seit 2017 innehat, war er intern unumstritten. Als Bundesverkehrsminister (2013-2017) hat er eine gemischte Bilanz hinterlassen: Auf sein Konto geht beispielsweise die gescheiterte „Ausländermaut“.

Dort ist er zuständig für die Bereiche Auswärtiges, Verteidigung und die Interparlamentarische Konferenz für die Gemeinsame Außen- und Sicherheitspolitik (GASP) und die Gemeinsame Sicherheits- und Verteidigungspolitik (GSVP) und Europarat.

"2025-04-28 04:02:00","Apple","Not Affected","Not Affected","Stimmung in der deutschen Wirtschaft nur leicht verbessert Die Unternehmen in Deutschland stufen ihre Lage als nicht mehr ganz so schlecht ein wie im vergangenen Herbst. Mit einem spürbaren Aufschwung rechnet die Mehrheit der Befragten aber nicht. Lediglich im Dienstleistungssektor könnten die Geschäfte in diesem Jahr wieder besser laufen als 2024. Die deutsche Wirtschaft hat seit mehreren Jahren mit jeder Menge Widrigkeiten zu kämpfen: gestiegene Kosten, eine unstete und wenig unternehmensfreundliche Wirtschaftspolitik der Bundesregierung und die von der US-Regierung zuletzt nochmals verstärkten geopolitischen Verwerfungen sind nur einige Beispiele. Immerhin zeigt die aktuelle IW-Konjunkturumfrage, dass die Unternehmen nicht mehr ganz so schwarzsehen wie noch vor einigen Monaten. Sagten im vergangenen Herbst 49 Prozent der Firmen, ihre Geschäftslage habe sich binnen Jahresfrist verschlechtert, sind es nun „nur“ noch 40 Prozent. Insgesamt zeigt der Daumen aber nach wie vor nach unten (Grafik): Der Saldo zwischen jenen Unternehmen, deren Geschäfte aktuell schlechter laufen als vor einem Jahr, und jenen, bei denen es aufwärts ging, beträgt immer noch 22 Prozentpunkte.

Die insgesamt negative Bewertung der Wirtschaftslage spiegelt sich auch in den Unternehmensmeldungen zu den Investitionen und zur Beschäftigung wider – bei beiden Indikatoren überwiegt nach wie vor der Anteil jener Unternehmen, die im Vergleich zum Vorjahr von einer Verschlechterung sprechen. Die Erwartungen der deutschen Unternehmen für 2025 haben sich aufgehellt, die Skeptiker sind nur noch geringfügig in der Mehrheit. Mit Blick auf den weiteren Jahresverlauf fallen die Umfrageergebnisse positiver aus, die Skeptiker sind nur noch geringfügig in der Mehrheit: Während 29 Prozent der Unternehmen in Deutschland für 2025 mit einem Produktionsrückgang gegenüber 2024 rechnen, erwarten 26 Prozent einen Anstieg. Auch die Investitionserwartungen haben sich aufgehellt: Der Saldo zwischen pessimistischen und optimistischen Unternehmen beträgt in diesem Frühjahr 7 Prozentpunkte – im vergangenen Herbst waren es noch 17 Punkte. Und auch auf die Beschäftigungsentwicklung blicken die vom IW befragten Firmen inzwischen etwas weniger sorgenvoll. Große Unterschiede zwischen den Wirtschaftsbereichen Hinter diesen allgemeinen Einschätzungen verbergen sich große Unterschiede zwischen den Unternehmen aus den verschiedenen Wirtschaftsbereichen: Industrie. Die Perspektiven in diesem Sektor sind aktuell weniger trüb als im Herbst 2024, mit einem wirklichen Aufwärtstrend rechnen die Firmen aber noch nicht (Grafik): Mit 38 Prozent geht eine relative Mehrheit der Industrieunternehmen von einem Produktionsrückgang im Jahr 2025 aus – 27 Prozent erwarten einen Anstieg.

Picture of Adrian Schmid Adrian Schmid | Letzte Aktualisierung am 8.04.2025 Mit seinem Zollhammer erschüttert Donald Trump die globale Wirtschaft – und die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit einem historischen Schockmoment. Seit dem 5. April 2025 gelten in den USA flächendeckende Importzölle von mindestens 10 Prozent, für Produkte aus China sogar 34 Prozent – mit der Drohung, diese um weitere 50 Prozent zu erhöhen. Diese Drohung ist bereits einen Tag später eingetreten – 104 Prozent Zölle gegen China! Die Folge? Ein Blutbad an den Börsen: Der Nasdaq stürzt in nur drei Handelstagen um über 16 Prozent ab Der S&P 500 verliert 15 Prozent Der DAX fällt sogar um 17 Prozent Rohstoffe wie WTI-Öl und Silber rauschen um bis zu 21 Prozent nach unten Der VIX explodiert auf über 60 – Angst dominiert die Wall Street Der Fear & Greed Index steht bei 4: Extreme Fear. Die Aktienmärkte stehen unter Schock – und doch: Mitten im Chaos entstehen neue Chancen. Denn während viele Exporteure, Konsumriesen und Big Tech-Aktien unter Druck geraten, profitieren andere direkt von Trumps Agenda. In diesem Artikel analysieren wir die Top 5 Donald Trump Aktien 2025 – Unternehmen, die vom neuen wirtschaftspolitischen Kurs profitieren könnten: durch nationale Investitionen, steuerliche Entlastungen und gezielte Branchenförderung. Welche Aktien könnten jetzt zur neuen Marktelite aufsteigen – und welche Rolle kann der „Trump-Turbo“ in Ihrem Depot spielen? Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt mit einem crash und börsenbeben, wahl sieg Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt / Shutterstock Donald Trumps Zollhammer 2025: So verändert der US-Präsident den Welthandel Was zunächst wie wirtschaftspolitischer Wahnsinn wirkt, folgt einer klaren Logik: US Präsident Donald Trump will die Vereinigten Staaten zur Festung der Produktion machen. Mit dem pauschalen Importzoll von mindestens 10 Prozent auf alle Waren (seit 5. April 2025) beginnt die Umsetzung seiner protektionistischen Vision einer „autarken Supermacht“. Besonders hart trifft es Länder mit hohen Handelsüberschüssen gegenüber den USA – allen voran China, das mit einer Zollbelastung von insgesamt 54 Prozent konfrontiert ist. Doch auch Deutschland, Japan, Kanada, Vietnam und die Schweiz spüren die neue Zollpolitik deutlich. Der US-Präsident hat klargemacht: Wer amerikanische Produkte blockiert oder unterbietet, zahlt den Preis. Was das bedeutet: Zollankündigung EU-Zölle: 20 Prozent Japan: 25 Prozent auf Autos, 24 Prozent auf Konsumgüter Kanada: 25 Prozent auf nicht in den USA hergestellte Autos Schweiz: 31 Prozent China: 34 Prozent + mögliche Aufstockung auf 50 Prozent Für über 40 Länder gelten Sonderzölle zwischen 30 und 50 Prozent – darunter viele asiatische und afrikanische Staaten. Gleichzeitig läuft eine 51-tägige Übergangsfrist, die bis zum 27. Mai 2025 für Waren gilt, die vor dem Stichtag verschifft wurden. Trumps strategisches Ziel: Handelsbilanz verbessern US-Produktion reindustrialisieren Abhängigkeiten von China & Europa verringern Neue Investitionsanreize im Inland schaffen Ergänzt wird der Zollhammer durch gezielte Ausnahmen für „kritische Rohstoffe und Technologien“ wie Halbleiter, Kupfer oder Arzneimittel – doch selbst diese könnten bald unter Trumps nächste Zollrunde fallen. Zwischenfazit: Trump nutzt den Zoll als geopolitisches und wirtschaftliches Werkzeug – nicht nur zur Machtdemonstration, sondern um gezielt Wachstum zurück in die USA zu zwingen. Für global aufgestellte Unternehmen ist das eine Herausforderung – für national fokussierte US-Konzerne eine historische Chance. DAX, Nasdaq & Co im freien Fall – Was jetzt nach dem Trump-Schock zählt Die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit beispielloser Wucht auf Trumps Zolloffensive – der sogenannte „Trump-Schock 2.0“ entfaltet seine volle Wucht. Innerhalb von nur drei Handelstagen erleben Anleger ein Szenario, das selbst krisenerprobte Marktteilnehmer sprachlos macht: Indizes im freien Fall Nasdaq Composite: –16 Prozent S&P 500: –15 Prozent DAX: –17 Prozent Rohstoffe brechen ein WTI-Öl: –18 Prozent Silber: –21 Prozent Panikindikatoren schlagen Alarm Volatilitätsindex VIX: springt auf über 60 Punkte – der zweithöchste Stand seit dem Corona-Crash Fear & Greed Index: fällt auf 4 von 100 – ein klares Signal für Extreme Fear Was wir erleben, ist nicht nur ein Börsenrücksetzer, sondern ein fundamentaler Stimmungsumschwung. Anleger fliehen aus Risikoassets, verkaufen Tech-Giganten und meiden exportorientierte Geschäftsmodelle. Der globale Kapitalstrom kehrt sich um – weg von Internationalisierung, hin zur nationalen Robustheit. Doch mitten im Tumult beginnt das große Umdenken: Denn während Exporteure taumeln, gewinnen andere an Stärke. US-Unternehmen mit starker Inlandsfokussierung, politischer Rückendeckung und direkter Nähe zu Trumps strategischer Agenda rücken plötzlich ins Zentrum des Anlegerinteresses. trump zoll ankündigung, sturm an den aktienmärken, handelskrieg Trump Zollkrieg / Shutterstock Was jetzt zählt: Wer liefert Stabilität im Inland? Wer profitiert von Staatsaufträgen, Deregulierung und Investitionen? Wer kann unter Trump schneller wachsen – weil die Regeln gelockert sind? Der Markt preist nicht nur Angst ein – er beginnt, neue Gewinner zu suchen. Diese Sektoren sind die neuen Gewinner unter Donald Trump – Aktien mit Potenzial Mit Zöllen, Deregulierung und milliardenschweren Investitionen hat Donald Trump die Spielregeln an der Börse neu definiert. Seine Wirtschaftspolitik belohnt nicht Internationalität, sondern strategischen Patriotismus: Wer in den USA produziert, sich auf das Heimatland fokussiert oder Trumps Agenda bedient, hat plötzlich die Nase vorn. Inmitten der Turbulenzen kristallisieren sich fünf Schlüsselbranchen heraus, die nun politisch priorisiert und finanziell begünstigt werden – und damit zu den neuen Hoffnungsträgern der Märkte avancieren könnten: 1. Verteidigung: Sicherheit wird wieder zur Aktienstory Was Trump will: Einen starken militärischen Industriekomplex. Das Verteidigungsbudget wächst um 80 Milliarden US-Dollar. Der Fokus liegt auf nationaler Unabhängigkeit, technologischem Vorsprung und militärischer Dominanz. Was die Märkte sehen: Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman und General Dynamics stehen am Anfang einer neuen Auftragswelle – von Hyperschallwaffen über Luftverteidigung bis zu autonomen Systemen. Analysten erwarten Milliardenaufträge im zweistelligen Bereich. Anlegerfazit: Planbare Umsätze, politische Priorität, hohe Eintrittsbarrieren. Verteidigung ist unter Trump kein Randthema – sie ist ein Investmenttrend. 2. Energie: Fossil wird wieder strategisch Was Trump will: Volle Energieunabhängigkeit. Öl, Gas, Kohle und Uran sollen Amerikas Grundversorgung sichern – nicht Windräder und Solarpanels aus China. Was die Märkte sehen: Exxon Mobil und Chevron profitieren von beschleunigten Genehmigungen, während Uranium Energy durch die Renaissance der Kernkraft neues Potenzial bekommt. Der Rohstoffmarkt dreht – nicht trotz, sondern wegen geopolitischer Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wachstum durch politische Rückendeckung. Trumps Energiepolitik favorisiert Konzerne mit US-Fokus und eigener Produktion. Ein Comeback fossiler Werte zeichnet sich ab. 3. Technologie & KI: Made in USA statt global Was Trump will: Die digitale Vorherrschaft der USA – unabhängig von europäischen Ethikregeln oder chinesischer Hardware. Das Stargate-Programm in Höhe von 500 Milliarden US-Dollar ist Ausdruck dieser Ambition. Was die Märkte sehen: Oracle als direkter Stargate-Partner profitiert ebenso wie Nvidia, Microsoft oder Palantir. Die Abschaffung regulatorischer Schranken könnte zusätzlich die Innovationsgeschwindigkeit erhöhen – wenn auch mit Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wer in KI investiert, investiert in die neue „digitale Infrastruktur Amerikas“. Trump verleiht dem Sektor nicht nur Budget, sondern auch narrative Schlagkraft. 4. Infrastruktur & Bau: Die Betonwende Was Trump will: Bauen, sichern, modernisieren. Straßen, Zäune, Wohnungen. Bauwirtschaft als Wachstumsanker und Jobmaschine. Was die Märkte sehen: Lennar, D.R. Horton und Caterpillar könnten von staatlichen Großprojekten profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten infolge verschärfter Immigration. Maschinenbauer wie Deere rücken ebenfalls in den Fokus. Anlegerfazit: Infrastrukturunternehmen mit US-Präsenz erhalten direkten Zugang zu Staatsaufträgen – ein klassisches Trump-Muster: Innen vor Außen. 5. Finanzen: Deregulierung Reloaded Was Trump will: Kapitalfreisetzung durch Steuererleichterungen, weniger Bürokratie und neue Anreize für M&A-Aktivitäten. Was die Märkte sehen: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan und Blackstone positionieren sich früh. Der M&A-Boom ist realistisch – ebenso wie steigende Margen im Trading und der Vermögensverwaltung. Anlegerfazit: Banken erleben ein Comeback der Deregulierung. Wer auf Transaktionen, Kreditvergabe und Asset Management setzt, könnte im Finanzsektor neue Erträge erschließen. Strategisches Zwischenfazit für Anleger: Die Politik bestimmt die Börsenordnung neu. Und Anleger, die Trumps Agenda frühzeitig verstehen, können gezielt profitieren. Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Verteidigung Aufrüstung, Sicherheit Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman Energie Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe Exxon, Chevron, Uranium Energy Technologie Stargate, KI-Förderung Oracle, Nvidia, Palanti Infrastruktur Bauprojekte, US-Subventionen Caterpillar, Lennar, D.R. Horton Finanzen Deregulierung, Steuern Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone Der Trump-Turbo für Anleger: Alternative Anlageformen wie ETFs Nicht jeder Privatanleger möchte oder kann gezielt einzelne US-Aktien auswählen, die potenziell von Trumps Politik profitieren. Eine interessante Alternative stellt hier ein Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) dar, der eine breite Streuung und Risikominderung ermöglicht. Durch den Kauf eines US-Aktien-ETFs lässt sich das Kapital auf viele amerikanische Unternehmen verteilen, wodurch man das Potenzial des gesamten US-Marktes nutzen und gleichzeitig das Risiko durch Diversifikation minimieren kann. Ein besonders attraktiver ETF für Börsianer, die am US-Markt partizipieren möchten, ist der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF (ISIN: IE00B3XXRP09). Dieser ETF bildet den S&P 500 Index ab, der die 500 größten US-Unternehmen umfasst. So können Investoren breit gestreut in die US-Wirtschaft investieren, ohne auf einzelne Aktien setzen zu müssen. Der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF hat eine Marktkapitalisierung von ca. 34,6 Milliarden USD (Stand 07.04.2025) und legt seinen Schwerpunkt auf die Branchen Technologie (33,5 Prozent), Finanzwesen (11,0 Prozent), Nicht-Basiskonsumgüter (10,8 Prozent), Gesundheitswesen (10,3 Prozent), in denen sich besonders viele Trump-begünstigte Unternehmen befinden könnten. Beispielsweise sind Schwergewichte wie Apple (7,0 Prozent), Microsoft (6,1 Prozent) und NVIDIA (6,6 Prozent) im ETF enthalten, was Anlegern Zugang zu den größten und profitabelsten Unternehmen der USA verschafft. Der ETF überzeugt zudem durch niedrige Gebühren: Die Gesamtkostenquote (Total Expense Ratio, TER) liegt bei nur 0,07 Prozent pro Jahr. Dividenden werden quartalsweise ausgeschüttet, wie zuletzt im März 2025 (0,30 USD je Anteil), was Anlegern einen zusätzlichen Ertrag ermöglicht. Trotz der attraktiven Möglichkeiten, die ein US-Aktien ETF wie der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF bietet, sollten Anleger jedoch darauf achten, nicht ihr gesamtes Kapital ausschließlich in den US-Markt zu investieren. ETFs auf internationale Märkte können helfen, die Volatilität zu reduzieren und das Risiko weiter zu streuen. Weitere ETFs für Ihren Vermögensaufbau finden Sie hier Beste ETFs.

Lockheed Martin Aktie: Neue Chancen durch erhöhte Verteidigungsausgaben Lockheed Martin Corporation (ISIN: US5398301094 – Symbol: LMT – Währung: USD) Die Lockheed Martin Corporation mit Hauptsitz in Bethesda, Maryland, ist ein weltweit führendes Unternehmen in der Luft- und Raumfahrt sowie im Verteidigungssektor.

In mehreren Reden betonte er, dass die militärische Überlegenheit der USA „wieder höchste Priorität“ habe. Lockheed Martin ist bereits heute mit über 70 Prozent seines Umsatzes vom US-Militär abhängig – und dürfte damit direkt von den neuen Großaufträgen profitieren.

Exxon Mobil Aktie: Neue Chancen durch Trumps Energiepolitik Exxon Mobil Corporation (ISIN: US30231G1022 – Symbol: XOM – Währung: USD) Die Exxon Mobil Corporation, mit Hauptsitz in Irving, Texas, ist eines der weltweit führenden Unternehmen in der Öl- und Gasindustrie. Das Unternehmen deckt die gesamte Wertschöpfungskette ab – von der Exploration über die Produktion bis hin zur Raffination und dem Vertrieb von Erdöl und Erdgas. Die Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „XOM“ gehandelt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 453 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) gehört Exxon Mobil zu den Schwergewichten im Energiesektor und hat eine herausragende Position auf dem globalen Markt. Trumps Energieagenda: Förderung statt Verzicht Donald Trump hat nach seiner Amtseinführung einen nationalen Energienotstand ausgerufen und der Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe höchste Priorität eingeräumt. Genehmigungsverfahren wurden vereinfacht, Umweltstandards gelockert und neue Bohrlizenzen im Offshore-Bereich freigegeben. Für Exxon Mobil bedeutet das konkret: Schnellere und günstigere Produktionsfreigaben Neue Infrastrukturprojekte wie Pipelines und Terminals Steuererleichterungen und Subventionen auf Bundesebene Rückzug aus klimapolitischen Verpflichtungen (Pariser Abkommen) Gleichzeitig erhöht sich der politische Druck auf erneuerbare Energien – was die Marktposition klassischer Öl- und Gasunternehmen zusätzlich stärkt.

USD KGV (2025e) ca. 14 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 3,8 Trotz schwächerer Ölpreise bleibt Exxon profitabel – auch dank effizienter Kostenstruktur, aggressiver Rückkäufe und wachsender Beteiligung an liquefied natural gas (LNG)-Projekten. Analysten sehen im Umfeld steigender globaler Nachfrage und nationaler Förderung weiteres Kurspotenzial. Anlegerfazit: Fossiler Champion mit politischem Schutzschild Exxon Mobil zählt zu den größten Gewinnern der neuen Energiepolitik in den USA. Der politische Rückenwind verstärkt die operative Stärke des Konzerns und macht ihn zu einem potenziellen Dauerläufer – auch in einem volatilen Marktumfeld.

Caterpillar Aktie: Infrastruktur-Maschine für Trumps Bauoffensive Caterpillar Inc. (ISIN: US1491231015 – Symbol: CAT – Währung: USD) Caterpillar ist der weltweit führende Hersteller von Baumaschinen, Diesel- und Gasmotoren, Industrieanlagen sowie Minenequipment. Das Unternehmen mit Sitz in Illinois gilt als konjunktursensitiver Schwergewichtsindex im US-Industriesektor – und ist eine Bau- und Infrastruktur-Aktie par excellence, mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 138 Milliarden US-Dollar (Stand: April 2025). Trumps Infrastrukturpolitik: America Builds Again Donald Trump hat bereits in seiner ersten Amtszeit Infrastrukturprojekte als zentrales Element seiner Wirtschaftspolitik propagiert – doch erst 2025 werden die Pläne massiv umgesetzt. Die neue Regierung kündigte ein 1-Billionen-US-Dollar-Programm zur Modernisierung von Straßen, Brücken, Pipelines und Energieinfrastruktur an. Caterpillar profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Staatliche Nachfrage nach Bau- und Erdbewegungsmaschinen Erleichterte Umweltauflagen für Bauprojekte Stärkung nationaler Lieferketten – Vorteil für US-Produktion Steuervorteile für Investitionen in Maschinen & Ausrüstung Fundamentale Entwicklung und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 67,1 Mrd. USD 71,5 Mrd. USD 75,2 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 9,2 Mrd. USD 10,0 Mrd. USD 10,6 Mrd. USD KGV (2025e) ca. 15 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 2,0 % Caterpillar ist nicht nur profitabel, sondern auch cashflow-stark. Die Nachfrage im US-Markt ist robust, die Book-to-Bill-Ratio in den Bereichen Bau & Mining liegt über 1 – ein Zeichen für solides Wachstum. Zusatztreiber: Deglobalisierung & Rohstoffwende Die protektionistische Handelspolitik der Trump-Regierung wirkt indirekt positiv auf Caterpillar. Denn mit steigenden Zöllen auf Maschinenimporte aus Europa und Asien gewinnen US-Produzenten an Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Gleichzeitig befeuert die globale Unsicherheit Investitionen in Energie- und Rohstoffgewinnung – ein weiteres Standbein für Caterpillar. Anlegerfazit: Realwirtschaftlicher Trump-Profiteur mit Substanz Caterpillar ist kein spekulativer Highflyer, sondern ein solider Konjunkturzykliker mit politischem Rückenwind. Wer auf reale Infrastrukturinvestitionen, Cashflows und US-zentriertes Wachstum setzen will, findet hier eine Trump-Aktie mit Substanz.

Oracle hat eine starke Position in der Technologiebranche und profitiert von der zunehmenden Digitalisierung und der Nachfrage nach skalierbaren Cloud-Diensten. Die Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „ORCL“ gehandelt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 360 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) spielt Oracle eine zentrale Rolle in der Entwicklung moderner IT-Infrastrukturen. Stargate: 500 Milliarden US-Dollar für Amerikas KI-Zukunft Donald Trump hat unmittelbar nach Amtsantritt ein Investitionsprogramm in Höhe von 500 Milliarden US-Dollar angekündigt, das den Ausbau der nationalen KI-Infrastruktur beschleunigen soll. Oracle ist – neben OpenAI und Softbank – einer der zentralen Technologiepartner. Was das konkret bedeutet: Großaufträge für Rechenzentren und Cloud-Kapazitäten Politische Unterstützung für inländische Datenverarbeitung Wegfall ethischer KI-Regulierung = höhere Innovationsgeschwindigkeit Positionierung als „Sicherheitsanbieter“ im Sinne nationaler Datensouveränität Oracle bringt mit seiner eigenen Cloud-Plattform (OCI – Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) und den weltweit genutzten Datenbanksystemen genau die Fähigkeiten mit, die jetzt politisch gewollt sind: schnell skalierbare Systeme, US-basiert und unter Kontrolle der Regierungspartner. Fundamentale Entwicklung und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 50,0 Mrd. USD 53,0 Mrd. USD 57,0 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 8,5 Mrd. USD 10,5 Mrd.

Für Anleger, die an ein wachsendes „Digital America“ glauben, ist Oracle eine strategische Trump-Aktie mit Substanz.

Die Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „GS“ gehandelt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 153 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) spielt Goldman Sachs eine zentrale Rolle im globalen Finanzsektor. Trump-Effekt: Deregulierung & M&A-Boom Donald Trump verfolgt einen wirtschaftsfreundlichen Kurs mit dem Ziel, die Finanzmärkte zu „entfesseln“. Regulatorische Auflagen aus der Dodd-Frank-Ära werden gelockert oder gestrichen, Kapitalvorgaben gelockert und steuerliche Anreize für Fusionen und Übernahmen geschaffen. Goldman profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Mehr Spielraum für profitable Eigenhandelsgeschäfte Neue Impulse im M&A-Geschäft – vor allem bei US-Konzernen Wachstum im Asset Management durch steuerbegünstigte Anlagevehikel Repatriierung von Kapital – stärkere US-Fokus-Strategien Die Bank hat bereits signalisiert, ihre M&A-Kapazitäten 2025 auszubauen und erwartet eine Zunahme von IPOs sowie Restrukturierungen in Industrie, Tech und Healthcare.

Anlegerfazit: Profiteur der Freiheit – und der Transaktionen Goldman Sachs zählt zu den wirtschaftspolitischen Hauptprofiteuren der Trump-Administration. Die Mischung aus politischem Rückenwind, strukturellem Wachstumsfeld (M&A, Private Equity) und starker Profitabilität macht die Aktie zu einem strategischen Trump-Investment im Finanzsektor.

BONUS: Trump-Watchlist 2025 – Diese Aktien könnten ebenfalls profitieren Nicht alle Trump-Profiteure haben es in die Top 5 geschafft – doch einige spannende Kandidaten verdienen dennoch einen Platz auf Ihrer Watchlist: Tesla (TSLA) Elon Musk steht Trump politisch überraschend nahe. Sollte Tesla von steuerlichen Erleichterungen, Inlandsproduktion und Infrastrukturprojekten profitieren, könnte die Aktie ungeahnt Rückenwind erhalten – auch ohne direkte Beteiligung am Stargate-Programm. Palantir (PLTR) Das Datenanalyse-Unternehmen mit starken Regierungsbeziehungen könnte im Zuge wachsender Sicherheitsausgaben und nationaler IT-Projekte zusätzliche Aufträge gewinnen – besonders im Bereich KI-gestützter Verteidigung. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Als größter US-Finanzkonzern profitiert JPMorgan breit von Trumps Finanzagenda – von M&A-Fantasie bis zur Kreditvergabe in der Infrastruktur. Lennar & D.R. Horton (LEN, DHI) Die beiden US-Baukonzerne könnten stark von Trumps Wohnungsbauoffensive profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten durch Einwanderungsregulierung. Deere & Company (DE) Als Hersteller von Land- und Baumaschinen ist Deere ein direkter Gewinner nationaler Infrastrukturprojekte – und könnte durch Importzölle auf ausländische Maschinen Marktanteile gewinnen. Hinweis: Diese Aktien sind spekulativer als die Top 5 – bieten aber unter Trumps politischer Agenda gezielte Chancen, vor allem im Bereich Technologie, Bau und nationale Sicherheit.","https://finment.com/boerse-aktien/us-aktien/top-donald-trump-aktien/"

Picture of Adrian Schmid Adrian Schmid | Letzte Aktualisierung am 8.04.2025 Mit seinem Zollhammer erschüttert Donald Trump die globale Wirtschaft – und die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit einem historischen Schockmoment. Seit dem 5. April 2025 gelten in den USA flächendeckende Importzölle von mindestens 10 Prozent, für Produkte aus China sogar 34 Prozent – mit der Drohung, diese um weitere 50 Prozent zu erhöhen. Diese Drohung ist bereits einen Tag später eingetreten – 104 Prozent Zölle gegen China! Die Folge? Ein Blutbad an den Börsen: Der Nasdaq stürzt in nur drei Handelstagen um über 16 Prozent ab Der S&P 500 verliert 15 Prozent Der DAX fällt sogar um 17 Prozent Rohstoffe wie WTI-Öl und Silber rauschen um bis zu 21 Prozent nach unten Der VIX explodiert auf über 60 – Angst dominiert die Wall Street Der Fear & Greed Index steht bei 4: Extreme Fear. Die Aktienmärkte stehen unter Schock – und doch: Mitten im Chaos entstehen neue Chancen. Denn während viele Exporteure, Konsumriesen und Big Tech-Aktien unter Druck geraten, profitieren andere direkt von Trumps Agenda. In diesem Artikel analysieren wir die Top 5 Donald Trump Aktien 2025 – Unternehmen, die vom neuen wirtschaftspolitischen Kurs profitieren könnten: durch nationale Investitionen, steuerliche Entlastungen und gezielte Branchenförderung. Welche Aktien könnten jetzt zur neuen Marktelite aufsteigen – und welche Rolle kann der „Trump-Turbo“ in Ihrem Depot spielen? Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt mit einem crash und börsenbeben, wahl sieg Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt / Shutterstock Donald Trumps Zollhammer 2025: So verändert der US-Präsident den Welthandel Was zunächst wie wirtschaftspolitischer Wahnsinn wirkt, folgt einer klaren Logik: US Präsident Donald Trump will die Vereinigten Staaten zur Festung der Produktion machen. Mit dem pauschalen Importzoll von mindestens 10 Prozent auf alle Waren (seit 5. April 2025) beginnt die Umsetzung seiner protektionistischen Vision einer „autarken Supermacht“. Besonders hart trifft es Länder mit hohen Handelsüberschüssen gegenüber den USA – allen voran China, das mit einer Zollbelastung von insgesamt 54 Prozent konfrontiert ist. Doch auch Deutschland, Japan, Kanada, Vietnam und die Schweiz spüren die neue Zollpolitik deutlich. Der US-Präsident hat klargemacht: Wer amerikanische Produkte blockiert oder unterbietet, zahlt den Preis. Was das bedeutet: Zollankündigung EU-Zölle: 20 Prozent Japan: 25 Prozent auf Autos, 24 Prozent auf Konsumgüter Kanada: 25 Prozent auf nicht in den USA hergestellte Autos Schweiz: 31 Prozent China: 34 Prozent + mögliche Aufstockung auf 50 Prozent Für über 40 Länder gelten Sonderzölle zwischen 30 und 50 Prozent – darunter viele asiatische und afrikanische Staaten. Gleichzeitig läuft eine 51-tägige Übergangsfrist, die bis zum 27. Mai 2025 für Waren gilt, die vor dem Stichtag verschifft wurden. Trumps strategisches Ziel: Handelsbilanz verbessern US-Produktion reindustrialisieren Abhängigkeiten von China & Europa verringern Neue Investitionsanreize im Inland schaffen Ergänzt wird der Zollhammer durch gezielte Ausnahmen für „kritische Rohstoffe und Technologien“ wie Halbleiter, Kupfer oder Arzneimittel – doch selbst diese könnten bald unter Trumps nächste Zollrunde fallen. Zwischenfazit: Trump nutzt den Zoll als geopolitisches und wirtschaftliches Werkzeug – nicht nur zur Machtdemonstration, sondern um gezielt Wachstum zurück in die USA zu zwingen. Für global aufgestellte Unternehmen ist das eine Herausforderung – für national fokussierte US-Konzerne eine historische Chance. DAX, Nasdaq & Co im freien Fall – Was jetzt nach dem Trump-Schock zählt Die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit beispielloser Wucht auf Trumps Zolloffensive – der sogenannte „Trump-Schock 2.0“ entfaltet seine volle Wucht. Innerhalb von nur drei Handelstagen erleben Anleger ein Szenario, das selbst krisenerprobte Marktteilnehmer sprachlos macht: Indizes im freien Fall Nasdaq Composite: –16 Prozent S&P 500: –15 Prozent DAX: –17 Prozent Rohstoffe brechen ein WTI-Öl: –18 Prozent Silber: –21 Prozent Panikindikatoren schlagen Alarm Volatilitätsindex VIX: springt auf über 60 Punkte – der zweithöchste Stand seit dem Corona-Crash Fear & Greed Index: fällt auf 4 von 100 – ein klares Signal für Extreme Fear Was wir erleben, ist nicht nur ein Börsenrücksetzer, sondern ein fundamentaler Stimmungsumschwung. Anleger fliehen aus Risikoassets, verkaufen Tech-Giganten und meiden exportorientierte Geschäftsmodelle. Der globale Kapitalstrom kehrt sich um – weg von Internationalisierung, hin zur nationalen Robustheit. Doch mitten im Tumult beginnt das große Umdenken: Denn während Exporteure taumeln, gewinnen andere an Stärke. US-Unternehmen mit starker Inlandsfokussierung, politischer Rückendeckung und direkter Nähe zu Trumps strategischer Agenda rücken plötzlich ins Zentrum des Anlegerinteresses. trump zoll ankündigung, sturm an den aktienmärken, handelskrieg Trump Zollkrieg / Shutterstock Was jetzt zählt: Wer liefert Stabilität im Inland? Wer profitiert von Staatsaufträgen, Deregulierung und Investitionen? Wer kann unter Trump schneller wachsen – weil die Regeln gelockert sind? Der Markt preist nicht nur Angst ein – er beginnt, neue Gewinner zu suchen. Diese Sektoren sind die neuen Gewinner unter Donald Trump – Aktien mit Potenzial Mit Zöllen, Deregulierung und milliardenschweren Investitionen hat Donald Trump die Spielregeln an der Börse neu definiert. Seine Wirtschaftspolitik belohnt nicht Internationalität, sondern strategischen Patriotismus: Wer in den USA produziert, sich auf das Heimatland fokussiert oder Trumps Agenda bedient, hat plötzlich die Nase vorn. Inmitten der Turbulenzen kristallisieren sich fünf Schlüsselbranchen heraus, die nun politisch priorisiert und finanziell begünstigt werden – und damit zu den neuen Hoffnungsträgern der Märkte avancieren könnten: 1. Verteidigung: Sicherheit wird wieder zur Aktienstory Was Trump will: Einen starken militärischen Industriekomplex. Das Verteidigungsbudget wächst um 80 Milliarden US-Dollar. Der Fokus liegt auf nationaler Unabhängigkeit, technologischem Vorsprung und militärischer Dominanz. Was die Märkte sehen: Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman und General Dynamics stehen am Anfang einer neuen Auftragswelle – von Hyperschallwaffen über Luftverteidigung bis zu autonomen Systemen. Analysten erwarten Milliardenaufträge im zweistelligen Bereich. Anlegerfazit: Planbare Umsätze, politische Priorität, hohe Eintrittsbarrieren. Verteidigung ist unter Trump kein Randthema – sie ist ein Investmenttrend. 2. Energie: Fossil wird wieder strategisch Was Trump will: Volle Energieunabhängigkeit. Öl, Gas, Kohle und Uran sollen Amerikas Grundversorgung sichern – nicht Windräder und Solarpanels aus China. Was die Märkte sehen: Exxon Mobil und Chevron profitieren von beschleunigten Genehmigungen, während Uranium Energy durch die Renaissance der Kernkraft neues Potenzial bekommt. Der Rohstoffmarkt dreht – nicht trotz, sondern wegen geopolitischer Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wachstum durch politische Rückendeckung. Trumps Energiepolitik favorisiert Konzerne mit US-Fokus und eigener Produktion. Ein Comeback fossiler Werte zeichnet sich ab. 3. Technologie & KI: Made in USA statt global Was Trump will: Die digitale Vorherrschaft der USA – unabhängig von europäischen Ethikregeln oder chinesischer Hardware. Das Stargate-Programm in Höhe von 500 Milliarden US-Dollar ist Ausdruck dieser Ambition. Was die Märkte sehen: Oracle als direkter Stargate-Partner profitiert ebenso wie Nvidia, Microsoft oder Palantir. Die Abschaffung regulatorischer Schranken könnte zusätzlich die Innovationsgeschwindigkeit erhöhen – wenn auch mit Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wer in KI investiert, investiert in die neue „digitale Infrastruktur Amerikas“. Trump verleiht dem Sektor nicht nur Budget, sondern auch narrative Schlagkraft. 4. Infrastruktur & Bau: Die Betonwende Was Trump will: Bauen, sichern, modernisieren. Straßen, Zäune, Wohnungen. Bauwirtschaft als Wachstumsanker und Jobmaschine. Was die Märkte sehen: Lennar, D.R. Horton und Caterpillar könnten von staatlichen Großprojekten profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten infolge verschärfter Immigration. Maschinenbauer wie Deere rücken ebenfalls in den Fokus. Anlegerfazit: Infrastrukturunternehmen mit US-Präsenz erhalten direkten Zugang zu Staatsaufträgen – ein klassisches Trump-Muster: Innen vor Außen. 5. Finanzen: Deregulierung Reloaded Was Trump will: Kapitalfreisetzung durch Steuererleichterungen, weniger Bürokratie und neue Anreize für M&A-Aktivitäten. Was die Märkte sehen: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan und Blackstone positionieren sich früh. Der M&A-Boom ist realistisch – ebenso wie steigende Margen im Trading und der Vermögensverwaltung. Anlegerfazit: Banken erleben ein Comeback der Deregulierung. Wer auf Transaktionen, Kreditvergabe und Asset Management setzt, könnte im Finanzsektor neue Erträge erschließen. Strategisches Zwischenfazit für Anleger: Die Politik bestimmt die Börsenordnung neu. Und Anleger, die Trumps Agenda frühzeitig verstehen, können gezielt profitieren. Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Verteidigung Aufrüstung, Sicherheit Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman Energie Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe Exxon, Chevron, Uranium Energy Technologie Stargate, KI-Förderung Oracle, Nvidia, Palanti Infrastruktur Bauprojekte, US-Subventionen Caterpillar, Lennar, D.R. Horton Finanzen Deregulierung, Steuern Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone Der Trump-Turbo für Anleger: Alternative Anlageformen wie ETFs Nicht jeder Privatanleger möchte oder kann gezielt einzelne US-Aktien auswählen, die potenziell von Trumps Politik profitieren. Eine interessante Alternative stellt hier ein Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) dar, der eine breite Streuung und Risikominderung ermöglicht. Durch den Kauf eines US-Aktien-ETFs lässt sich das Kapital auf viele amerikanische Unternehmen verteilen, wodurch man das Potenzial des gesamten US-Marktes nutzen und gleichzeitig das Risiko durch Diversifikation minimieren kann. Ein besonders attraktiver ETF für Börsianer, die am US-Markt partizipieren möchten, ist der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF (ISIN: IE00B3XXRP09). Dieser ETF bildet den S&P 500 Index ab, der die 500 größten US-Unternehmen umfasst. So können Investoren breit gestreut in die US-Wirtschaft investieren, ohne auf einzelne Aktien setzen zu müssen. Der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF hat eine Marktkapitalisierung von ca. 34,6 Milliarden USD (Stand 07.04.2025) und legt seinen Schwerpunkt auf die Branchen Technologie (33,5 Prozent), Finanzwesen (11,0 Prozent), Nicht-Basiskonsumgüter (10,8 Prozent), Gesundheitswesen (10,3 Prozent), in denen sich besonders viele Trump-begünstigte Unternehmen befinden könnten. Beispielsweise sind Schwergewichte wie Apple (7,0 Prozent), Microsoft (6,1 Prozent) und NVIDIA (6,6 Prozent) im ETF enthalten, was Anlegern Zugang zu den größten und profitabelsten Unternehmen der USA verschafft. Der ETF überzeugt zudem durch niedrige Gebühren: Die Gesamtkostenquote (Total Expense Ratio, TER) liegt bei nur 0,07 Prozent pro Jahr. Dividenden werden quartalsweise ausgeschüttet, wie zuletzt im März 2025 (0,30 USD je Anteil), was Anlegern einen zusätzlichen Ertrag ermöglicht. Trotz der attraktiven Möglichkeiten, die ein US-Aktien ETF wie der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF bietet, sollten Anleger jedoch darauf achten, nicht ihr gesamtes Kapital ausschließlich in den US-Markt zu investieren. ETFs auf internationale Märkte können helfen, die Volatilität zu reduzieren und das Risiko weiter zu streuen. Weitere ETFs für Ihren Vermögensaufbau finden Sie hier Beste ETFs.

Exxon Mobil Aktie: Neue Chancen durch Trumps Energiepolitik Exxon Mobil Corporation (ISIN: US30231G1022 – Symbol: XOM – Währung: USD) Die Exxon Mobil Corporation, mit Hauptsitz in Irving, Texas, ist eines der weltweit führenden Unternehmen in der Öl- und Gasindustrie. Das Unternehmen deckt die gesamte Wertschöpfungskette ab – von der Exploration über die Produktion bis hin zur Raffination und dem Vertrieb von Erdöl und Erdgas. Die Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „XOM“ gehandelt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 453 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) gehört Exxon Mobil zu den Schwergewichten im Energiesektor und hat eine herausragende Position auf dem globalen Markt. Trumps Energieagenda: Förderung statt Verzicht Donald Trump hat nach seiner Amtseinführung einen nationalen Energienotstand ausgerufen und der Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe höchste Priorität eingeräumt. Genehmigungsverfahren wurden vereinfacht, Umweltstandards gelockert und neue Bohrlizenzen im Offshore-Bereich freigegeben. Für Exxon Mobil bedeutet das konkret: Schnellere und günstigere Produktionsfreigaben Neue Infrastrukturprojekte wie Pipelines und Terminals Steuererleichterungen und Subventionen auf Bundesebene Rückzug aus klimapolitischen Verpflichtungen (Pariser Abkommen) Gleichzeitig erhöht sich der politische Druck auf erneuerbare Energien – was die Marktposition klassischer Öl- und Gasunternehmen zusätzlich stärkt.

USD KGV (2025e) ca. 14 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 3,8 Trotz schwächerer Ölpreise bleibt Exxon profitabel – auch dank effizienter Kostenstruktur, aggressiver Rückkäufe und wachsender Beteiligung an liquefied natural gas (LNG)-Projekten. Analysten sehen im Umfeld steigender globaler Nachfrage und nationaler Förderung weiteres Kurspotenzial. Anlegerfazit: Fossiler Champion mit politischem Schutzschild Exxon Mobil zählt zu den größten Gewinnern der neuen Energiepolitik in den USA. Der politische Rückenwind verstärkt die operative Stärke des Konzerns und macht ihn zu einem potenziellen Dauerläufer – auch in einem volatilen Marktumfeld. Trump-Faktor: Sehr hoch Risiken: Ölpreisabhängigkeit, geopolitische Spannungen Chancen: Genehmigungsschub, steuerliche Vorteile, Infrastruktur-Boom aktienchart von exxon mobil Exxon Mobil Aktienchart 2021 – 2025 / FinMent 3. Caterpillar Aktie: Infrastruktur-Maschine für Trumps Bauoffensive Caterpillar Inc. (ISIN: US1491231015 – Symbol: CAT – Währung: USD) Caterpillar ist der weltweit führende Hersteller von Baumaschinen, Diesel- und Gasmotoren, Industrieanlagen sowie Minenequipment. Das Unternehmen mit Sitz in Illinois gilt als konjunktursensitiver Schwergewichtsindex im US-Industriesektor – und ist eine Bau- und Infrastruktur-Aktie par excellence, mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 138 Milliarden US-Dollar (Stand: April 2025). Trumps Infrastrukturpolitik: America Builds Again Donald Trump hat bereits in seiner ersten Amtszeit Infrastrukturprojekte als zentrales Element seiner Wirtschaftspolitik propagiert – doch erst 2025 werden die Pläne massiv umgesetzt. Die neue Regierung kündigte ein 1-Billionen-US-Dollar-Programm zur Modernisierung von Straßen, Brücken, Pipelines und Energieinfrastruktur an. Caterpillar profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Staatliche Nachfrage nach Bau- und Erdbewegungsmaschinen Erleichterte Umweltauflagen für Bauprojekte Stärkung nationaler Lieferketten – Vorteil für US-Produktion Steuervorteile für Investitionen in Maschinen & Ausrüstung Fundamentale Entwicklung und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 67,1 Mrd. USD 71,5 Mrd. USD 75,2 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 9,2 Mrd. USD 10,0 Mrd. USD 10,6 Mrd. USD KGV (2025e) ca. 15 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 2,0 % Caterpillar ist nicht nur profitabel, sondern auch cashflow-stark. Die Nachfrage im US-Markt ist robust, die Book-to-Bill-Ratio in den Bereichen Bau & Mining liegt über 1 – ein Zeichen für solides Wachstum. Zusatztreiber: Deglobalisierung & Rohstoffwende Die protektionistische Handelspolitik der Trump-Regierung wirkt indirekt positiv auf Caterpillar. Denn mit steigenden Zöllen auf Maschinenimporte aus Europa und Asien gewinnen US-Produzenten an Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Gleichzeitig befeuert die globale Unsicherheit Investitionen in Energie- und Rohstoffgewinnung – ein weiteres Standbein für Caterpillar. Anlegerfazit: Realwirtschaftlicher Trump-Profiteur mit Substanz Caterpillar ist kein spekulativer Highflyer, sondern ein solider Konjunkturzykliker mit politischem Rückenwind. Wer auf reale Infrastrukturinvestitionen, Cashflows und US-zentriertes Wachstum setzen will, findet hier eine Trump-Aktie mit Substanz.

Oracle ist – neben OpenAI und Softbank – einer der zentralen Technologiepartner. Was das konkret bedeutet: Großaufträge für Rechenzentren und Cloud-Kapazitäten Politische Unterstützung für inländische Datenverarbeitung Wegfall ethischer KI-Regulierung = höhere Innovationsgeschwindigkeit Positionierung als „Sicherheitsanbieter“ im Sinne nationaler Datensouveränität Oracle bringt mit seiner eigenen Cloud-Plattform (OCI – Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) und den weltweit genutzten Datenbanksystemen genau die Fähigkeiten mit, die jetzt politisch gewollt sind: schnell skalierbare Systeme, US-basiert und unter Kontrolle der Regierungspartner. Fundamentale Entwicklung und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 50,0 Mrd. USD 53,0 Mrd. USD 57,0 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 8,5 Mrd. USD 10,5 Mrd.

Trump-Effekt: Deregulierung & M&A-Boom Donald Trump verfolgt einen wirtschaftsfreundlichen Kurs mit dem Ziel, die Finanzmärkte zu „entfesseln“. Regulatorische Auflagen aus der Dodd-Frank-Ära werden gelockert oder gestrichen, Kapitalvorgaben gelockert und steuerliche Anreize für Fusionen und Übernahmen geschaffen. Goldman profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Mehr Spielraum für profitable Eigenhandelsgeschäfte Neue Impulse im M&A-Geschäft – vor allem bei US-Konzernen Wachstum im Asset Management durch steuerbegünstigte Anlagevehikel Repatriierung von Kapital – stärkere US-Fokus-Strategien Die Bank hat bereits signalisiert, ihre M&A-Kapazitäten 2025 auszubauen und erwartet eine Zunahme von IPOs sowie Restrukturierungen in Industrie, Tech und Healthcare. Fundamentale Entwicklung und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 46,5 Mrd. USD 53,5 Mrd. USD 56,4 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 7,9 Mrd. USD 13,5 Mrd.

Anlegerfazit: Profiteur der Freiheit – und der Transaktionen Goldman Sachs zählt zu den wirtschaftspolitischen Hauptprofiteuren der Trump-Administration. Die Mischung aus politischem Rückenwind, strukturellem Wachstumsfeld (M&A, Private Equity) und starker Profitabilität macht die Aktie zu einem strategischen Trump-Investment im Finanzsektor.

BONUS: Trump-Watchlist 2025 – Diese Aktien könnten ebenfalls profitieren Nicht alle Trump-Profiteure haben es in die Top 5 geschafft – doch einige spannende Kandidaten verdienen dennoch einen Platz auf Ihrer Watchlist: Tesla (TSLA) Elon Musk steht Trump politisch überraschend nahe. Sollte Tesla von steuerlichen Erleichterungen, Inlandsproduktion und Infrastrukturprojekten profitieren, könnte die Aktie ungeahnt Rückenwind erhalten – auch ohne direkte Beteiligung am Stargate-Programm. Palantir (PLTR) Das Datenanalyse-Unternehmen mit starken Regierungsbeziehungen könnte im Zuge wachsender Sicherheitsausgaben und nationaler IT-Projekte zusätzliche Aufträge gewinnen – besonders im Bereich KI-gestützter Verteidigung. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Als größter US-Finanzkonzern profitiert JPMorgan breit von Trumps Finanzagenda – von M&A-Fantasie bis zur Kreditvergabe in der Infrastruktur. Lennar & D.R. Horton (LEN, DHI) Die beiden US-Baukonzerne könnten stark von Trumps Wohnungsbauoffensive profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten durch Einwanderungsregulierung. Deere & Company (DE) Als Hersteller von Land- und Baumaschinen ist Deere ein direkter Gewinner nationaler Infrastrukturprojekte – und könnte durch Importzölle auf ausländische Maschinen Marktanteile gewinnen. Hinweis: Diese Aktien sind spekulativer als die Top 5 – bieten aber unter Trumps politischer Agenda gezielte Chancen, vor allem im Bereich Technologie, Bau und nationale Sicherheit.","https://finment.com/boerse-aktien/us-aktien/top-donald-trump-aktien/"

Picture of Adrian Schmid Adrian Schmid | Letzte Aktualisierung am 8.04.2025 Mit seinem Zollhammer erschüttert Donald Trump die globale Wirtschaft – und die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit einem historischen Schockmoment. Seit dem 5. April 2025 gelten in den USA flächendeckende Importzölle von mindestens 10 Prozent, für Produkte aus China sogar 34 Prozent – mit der Drohung, diese um weitere 50 Prozent zu erhöhen. Diese Drohung ist bereits einen Tag später eingetreten – 104 Prozent Zölle gegen China! Die Folge? Ein Blutbad an den Börsen: Der Nasdaq stürzt in nur drei Handelstagen um über 16 Prozent ab Der S&P 500 verliert 15 Prozent Der DAX fällt sogar um 17 Prozent Rohstoffe wie WTI-Öl und Silber rauschen um bis zu 21 Prozent nach unten Der VIX explodiert auf über 60 – Angst dominiert die Wall Street Der Fear & Greed Index steht bei 4: Extreme Fear. Die Aktienmärkte stehen unter Schock – und doch: Mitten im Chaos entstehen neue Chancen. Denn während viele Exporteure, Konsumriesen und Big Tech-Aktien unter Druck geraten, profitieren andere direkt von Trumps Agenda. In diesem Artikel analysieren wir die Top 5 Donald Trump Aktien 2025 – Unternehmen, die vom neuen wirtschaftspolitischen Kurs profitieren könnten: durch nationale Investitionen, steuerliche Entlastungen und gezielte Branchenförderung. Welche Aktien könnten jetzt zur neuen Marktelite aufsteigen – und welche Rolle kann der „Trump-Turbo“ in Ihrem Depot spielen? Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt mit einem crash und börsenbeben, wahl sieg Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt / Shutterstock Donald Trumps Zollhammer 2025: So verändert der US-Präsident den Welthandel Was zunächst wie wirtschaftspolitischer Wahnsinn wirkt, folgt einer klaren Logik: US Präsident Donald Trump will die Vereinigten Staaten zur Festung der Produktion machen. Mit dem pauschalen Importzoll von mindestens 10 Prozent auf alle Waren (seit 5. April 2025) beginnt die Umsetzung seiner protektionistischen Vision einer „autarken Supermacht“. Besonders hart trifft es Länder mit hohen Handelsüberschüssen gegenüber den USA – allen voran China, das mit einer Zollbelastung von insgesamt 54 Prozent konfrontiert ist. Doch auch Deutschland, Japan, Kanada, Vietnam und die Schweiz spüren die neue Zollpolitik deutlich. Der US-Präsident hat klargemacht: Wer amerikanische Produkte blockiert oder unterbietet, zahlt den Preis. Was das bedeutet: Zollankündigung EU-Zölle: 20 Prozent Japan: 25 Prozent auf Autos, 24 Prozent auf Konsumgüter Kanada: 25 Prozent auf nicht in den USA hergestellte Autos Schweiz: 31 Prozent China: 34 Prozent + mögliche Aufstockung auf 50 Prozent Für über 40 Länder gelten Sonderzölle zwischen 30 und 50 Prozent – darunter viele asiatische und afrikanische Staaten. Gleichzeitig läuft eine 51-tägige Übergangsfrist, die bis zum 27. Mai 2025 für Waren gilt, die vor dem Stichtag verschifft wurden. Trumps strategisches Ziel: Handelsbilanz verbessern US-Produktion reindustrialisieren Abhängigkeiten von China & Europa verringern Neue Investitionsanreize im Inland schaffen Ergänzt wird der Zollhammer durch gezielte Ausnahmen für „kritische Rohstoffe und Technologien“ wie Halbleiter, Kupfer oder Arzneimittel – doch selbst diese könnten bald unter Trumps nächste Zollrunde fallen. Zwischenfazit: Trump nutzt den Zoll als geopolitisches und wirtschaftliches Werkzeug – nicht nur zur Machtdemonstration, sondern um gezielt Wachstum zurück in die USA zu zwingen. Für global aufgestellte Unternehmen ist das eine Herausforderung – für national fokussierte US-Konzerne eine historische Chance. DAX, Nasdaq & Co im freien Fall – Was jetzt nach dem Trump-Schock zählt Die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit beispielloser Wucht auf Trumps Zolloffensive – der sogenannte „Trump-Schock 2.0“ entfaltet seine volle Wucht. Innerhalb von nur drei Handelstagen erleben Anleger ein Szenario, das selbst krisenerprobte Marktteilnehmer sprachlos macht: Indizes im freien Fall Nasdaq Composite: –16 Prozent S&P 500: –15 Prozent DAX: –17 Prozent Rohstoffe brechen ein WTI-Öl: –18 Prozent Silber: –21 Prozent Panikindikatoren schlagen Alarm Volatilitätsindex VIX: springt auf über 60 Punkte – der zweithöchste Stand seit dem Corona-Crash Fear & Greed Index: fällt auf 4 von 100 – ein klares Signal für Extreme Fear Was wir erleben, ist nicht nur ein Börsenrücksetzer, sondern ein fundamentaler Stimmungsumschwung. Anleger fliehen aus Risikoassets, verkaufen Tech-Giganten und meiden exportorientierte Geschäftsmodelle. Der globale Kapitalstrom kehrt sich um – weg von Internationalisierung, hin zur nationalen Robustheit. Doch mitten im Tumult beginnt das große Umdenken: Denn während Exporteure taumeln, gewinnen andere an Stärke. US-Unternehmen mit starker Inlandsfokussierung, politischer Rückendeckung und direkter Nähe zu Trumps strategischer Agenda rücken plötzlich ins Zentrum des Anlegerinteresses. trump zoll ankündigung, sturm an den aktienmärken, handelskrieg Trump Zollkrieg / Shutterstock Was jetzt zählt: Wer liefert Stabilität im Inland? Wer profitiert von Staatsaufträgen, Deregulierung und Investitionen? Wer kann unter Trump schneller wachsen – weil die Regeln gelockert sind? Der Markt preist nicht nur Angst ein – er beginnt, neue Gewinner zu suchen. Diese Sektoren sind die neuen Gewinner unter Donald Trump – Aktien mit Potenzial Mit Zöllen, Deregulierung und milliardenschweren Investitionen hat Donald Trump die Spielregeln an der Börse neu definiert. Seine Wirtschaftspolitik belohnt nicht Internationalität, sondern strategischen Patriotismus: Wer in den USA produziert, sich auf das Heimatland fokussiert oder Trumps Agenda bedient, hat plötzlich die Nase vorn. Inmitten der Turbulenzen kristallisieren sich fünf Schlüsselbranchen heraus, die nun politisch priorisiert und finanziell begünstigt werden – und damit zu den neuen Hoffnungsträgern der Märkte avancieren könnten: 1. Verteidigung: Sicherheit wird wieder zur Aktienstory Was Trump will: Einen starken militärischen Industriekomplex. Das Verteidigungsbudget wächst um 80 Milliarden US-Dollar. Der Fokus liegt auf nationaler Unabhängigkeit, technologischem Vorsprung und militärischer Dominanz. Was die Märkte sehen: Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman und General Dynamics stehen am Anfang einer neuen Auftragswelle – von Hyperschallwaffen über Luftverteidigung bis zu autonomen Systemen. Analysten erwarten Milliardenaufträge im zweistelligen Bereich. Anlegerfazit: Planbare Umsätze, politische Priorität, hohe Eintrittsbarrieren. Verteidigung ist unter Trump kein Randthema – sie ist ein Investmenttrend. 2. Energie: Fossil wird wieder strategisch Was Trump will: Volle Energieunabhängigkeit. Öl, Gas, Kohle und Uran sollen Amerikas Grundversorgung sichern – nicht Windräder und Solarpanels aus China. Was die Märkte sehen: Exxon Mobil und Chevron profitieren von beschleunigten Genehmigungen, während Uranium Energy durch die Renaissance der Kernkraft neues Potenzial bekommt. Der Rohstoffmarkt dreht – nicht trotz, sondern wegen geopolitischer Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wachstum durch politische Rückendeckung. Trumps Energiepolitik favorisiert Konzerne mit US-Fokus und eigener Produktion. Ein Comeback fossiler Werte zeichnet sich ab. 3. Technologie & KI: Made in USA statt global Was Trump will: Die digitale Vorherrschaft der USA – unabhängig von europäischen Ethikregeln oder chinesischer Hardware. Das Stargate-Programm in Höhe von 500 Milliarden US-Dollar ist Ausdruck dieser Ambition. Was die Märkte sehen: Oracle als direkter Stargate-Partner profitiert ebenso wie Nvidia, Microsoft oder Palantir. Die Abschaffung regulatorischer Schranken könnte zusätzlich die Innovationsgeschwindigkeit erhöhen – wenn auch mit Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wer in KI investiert, investiert in die neue „digitale Infrastruktur Amerikas“. Trump verleiht dem Sektor nicht nur Budget, sondern auch narrative Schlagkraft. 4. Infrastruktur & Bau: Die Betonwende Was Trump will: Bauen, sichern, modernisieren. Straßen, Zäune, Wohnungen. Bauwirtschaft als Wachstumsanker und Jobmaschine. Was die Märkte sehen: Lennar, D.R. Horton und Caterpillar könnten von staatlichen Großprojekten profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten infolge verschärfter Immigration. Maschinenbauer wie Deere rücken ebenfalls in den Fokus. Anlegerfazit: Infrastrukturunternehmen mit US-Präsenz erhalten direkten Zugang zu Staatsaufträgen – ein klassisches Trump-Muster: Innen vor Außen. 5. Finanzen: Deregulierung Reloaded Was Trump will: Kapitalfreisetzung durch Steuererleichterungen, weniger Bürokratie und neue Anreize für M&A-Aktivitäten. Was die Märkte sehen: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan und Blackstone positionieren sich früh. Der M&A-Boom ist realistisch – ebenso wie steigende Margen im Trading und der Vermögensverwaltung. Anlegerfazit: Banken erleben ein Comeback der Deregulierung. Wer auf Transaktionen, Kreditvergabe und Asset Management setzt, könnte im Finanzsektor neue Erträge erschließen. Strategisches Zwischenfazit für Anleger: Die Politik bestimmt die Börsenordnung neu. Und Anleger, die Trumps Agenda frühzeitig verstehen, können gezielt profitieren. Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Verteidigung Aufrüstung, Sicherheit Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman Energie Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe Exxon, Chevron, Uranium Energy Technologie Stargate, KI-Förderung Oracle, Nvidia, Palanti Infrastruktur Bauprojekte, US-Subventionen Caterpillar, Lennar, D.R. Horton Finanzen Deregulierung, Steuern Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone Der Trump-Turbo für Anleger: Alternative Anlageformen wie ETFs Nicht jeder Privatanleger möchte oder kann gezielt einzelne US-Aktien auswählen, die potenziell von Trumps Politik profitieren. Eine interessante Alternative stellt hier ein Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) dar, der eine breite Streuung und Risikominderung ermöglicht. Durch den Kauf eines US-Aktien-ETFs lässt sich das Kapital auf viele amerikanische Unternehmen verteilen, wodurch man das Potenzial des gesamten US-Marktes nutzen und gleichzeitig das Risiko durch Diversifikation minimieren kann. Ein besonders attraktiver ETF für Börsianer, die am US-Markt partizipieren möchten, ist der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF (ISIN: IE00B3XXRP09). Dieser ETF bildet den S&P 500 Index ab, der die 500 größten US-Unternehmen umfasst. So können Investoren breit gestreut in die US-Wirtschaft investieren, ohne auf einzelne Aktien setzen zu müssen. Der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF hat eine Marktkapitalisierung von ca. 34,6 Milliarden USD (Stand 07.04.2025) und legt seinen Schwerpunkt auf die Branchen Technologie (33,5 Prozent), Finanzwesen (11,0 Prozent), Nicht-Basiskonsumgüter (10,8 Prozent), Gesundheitswesen (10,3 Prozent), in denen sich besonders viele Trump-begünstigte Unternehmen befinden könnten. Beispielsweise sind Schwergewichte wie Apple (7,0 Prozent), Microsoft (6,1 Prozent) und NVIDIA (6,6 Prozent) im ETF enthalten, was Anlegern Zugang zu den größten und profitabelsten Unternehmen der USA verschafft. Der ETF überzeugt zudem durch niedrige Gebühren: Die Gesamtkostenquote (Total Expense Ratio, TER) liegt bei nur 0,07 Prozent pro Jahr. Dividenden werden quartalsweise ausgeschüttet, wie zuletzt im März 2025 (0,30 USD je Anteil), was Anlegern einen zusätzlichen Ertrag ermöglicht. Trotz der attraktiven Möglichkeiten, die ein US-Aktien ETF wie der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF bietet, sollten Anleger jedoch darauf achten, nicht ihr gesamtes Kapital ausschließlich in den US-Markt zu investieren. ETFs auf internationale Märkte können helfen, die Volatilität zu reduzieren und das Risiko weiter zu streuen. Weitere ETFs für Ihren Vermögensaufbau finden Sie hier Beste ETFs.

Für Exxon Mobil bedeutet das konkret: Schnellere und günstigere Produktionsfreigaben Neue Infrastrukturprojekte wie Pipelines und Terminals Steuererleichterungen und Subventionen auf Bundesebene Rückzug aus klimapolitischen Verpflichtungen (Pariser Abkommen) Gleichzeitig erhöht sich der politische Druck auf erneuerbare Energien – was die Marktposition klassischer Öl- und Gasunternehmen zusätzlich stärkt.

Analysten sehen im Umfeld steigender globaler Nachfrage und nationaler Förderung weiteres Kurspotenzial. Anlegerfazit: Fossiler Champion mit politischem Schutzschild Exxon Mobil zählt zu den größten Gewinnern der neuen Energiepolitik in den USA. Der politische Rückenwind verstärkt die operative Stärke des Konzerns und macht ihn zu einem potenziellen Dauerläufer – auch in einem volatilen Marktumfeld.

Caterpillar Aktie: Infrastruktur-Maschine für Trumps Bauoffensive Caterpillar Inc. (ISIN: US1491231015 – Symbol: CAT – Währung: USD) Caterpillar ist der weltweit führende Hersteller von Baumaschinen, Diesel- und Gasmotoren, Industrieanlagen sowie Minenequipment. Das Unternehmen mit Sitz in Illinois gilt als konjunktursensitiver Schwergewichtsindex im US-Industriesektor – und ist eine Bau- und Infrastruktur-Aktie par excellence, mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 138 Milliarden US-Dollar (Stand: April 2025). Trumps Infrastrukturpolitik: America Builds Again Donald Trump hat bereits in seiner ersten Amtszeit Infrastrukturprojekte als zentrales Element seiner Wirtschaftspolitik propagiert – doch erst 2025 werden die Pläne massiv umgesetzt. Die neue Regierung kündigte ein 1-Billionen-US-Dollar-Programm zur Modernisierung von Straßen, Brücken, Pipelines und Energieinfrastruktur an. Caterpillar profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Staatliche Nachfrage nach Bau- und Erdbewegungsmaschinen Erleichterte Umweltauflagen für Bauprojekte Stärkung nationaler Lieferketten – Vorteil für US-Produktion Steuervorteile für Investitionen in Maschinen & Ausrüstung Fundamentale Entwicklung und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 67,1 Mrd. USD 71,5 Mrd. USD 75,2 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 9,2 Mrd. USD 10,0 Mrd. USD 10,6 Mrd. USD KGV (2025e) ca. 15 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 2,0 % Caterpillar ist nicht nur profitabel, sondern auch cashflow-stark. Die Nachfrage im US-Markt ist robust, die Book-to-Bill-Ratio in den Bereichen Bau & Mining liegt über 1 – ein Zeichen für solides Wachstum. Zusatztreiber: Deglobalisierung & Rohstoffwende Die protektionistische Handelspolitik der Trump-Regierung wirkt indirekt positiv auf Caterpillar. Denn mit steigenden Zöllen auf Maschinenimporte aus Europa und Asien gewinnen US-Produzenten an Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Gleichzeitig befeuert die globale Unsicherheit Investitionen in Energie- und Rohstoffgewinnung – ein weiteres Standbein für Caterpillar. Anlegerfazit: Realwirtschaftlicher Trump-Profiteur mit Substanz Caterpillar ist kein spekulativer Highflyer, sondern ein solider Konjunkturzykliker mit politischem Rückenwind. Wer auf reale Infrastrukturinvestitionen, Cashflows und US-zentriertes Wachstum setzen will, findet hier eine Trump-Aktie mit Substanz. Trump-Faktor: Hoch Risiken: Zinssensitivität, Projektverzögerungen Chancen: Staatsaufträge, Investitionsdynamik, Subventionsvorteile Caterpillar Aktienchart 2021 – 2025 / FinMent 2.

Oracle ist – neben OpenAI und Softbank – einer der zentralen Technologiepartner. Was das konkret bedeutet: Großaufträge für Rechenzentren und Cloud-Kapazitäten Politische Unterstützung für inländische Datenverarbeitung Wegfall ethischer KI-Regulierung = höhere Innovationsgeschwindigkeit Positionierung als „Sicherheitsanbieter“ im Sinne nationaler Datensouveränität Oracle bringt mit seiner eigenen Cloud-Plattform (OCI – Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) und den weltweit genutzten Datenbanksystemen genau die Fähigkeiten mit, die jetzt politisch gewollt sind: schnell skalierbare Systeme, US-basiert und unter Kontrolle der Regierungspartner. Fundamentale Entwicklung und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 50,0 Mrd. USD 53,0 Mrd. USD 57,0 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 8,5 Mrd. USD 10,5 Mrd.

Für Anleger, die an ein wachsendes „Digital America“ glauben, ist Oracle eine strategische Trump-Aktie mit Substanz.

Regulatorische Auflagen aus der Dodd-Frank-Ära werden gelockert oder gestrichen, Kapitalvorgaben gelockert und steuerliche Anreize für Fusionen und Übernahmen geschaffen. Goldman profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Mehr Spielraum für profitable Eigenhandelsgeschäfte Neue Impulse im M&A-Geschäft – vor allem bei US-Konzernen Wachstum im Asset Management durch steuerbegünstigte Anlagevehikel Repatriierung von Kapital – stärkere US-Fokus-Strategien Die Bank hat bereits signalisiert, ihre M&A-Kapazitäten 2025 auszubauen und erwartet eine Zunahme von IPOs sowie Restrukturierungen in Industrie, Tech und Healthcare.

BONUS: Trump-Watchlist 2025 – Diese Aktien könnten ebenfalls profitieren Nicht alle Trump-Profiteure haben es in die Top 5 geschafft – doch einige spannende Kandidaten verdienen dennoch einen Platz auf Ihrer Watchlist: Tesla (TSLA) Elon Musk steht Trump politisch überraschend nahe. Sollte Tesla von steuerlichen Erleichterungen, Inlandsproduktion und Infrastrukturprojekten profitieren, könnte die Aktie ungeahnt Rückenwind erhalten – auch ohne direkte Beteiligung am Stargate-Programm. Palantir (PLTR) Das Datenanalyse-Unternehmen mit starken Regierungsbeziehungen könnte im Zuge wachsender Sicherheitsausgaben und nationaler IT-Projekte zusätzliche Aufträge gewinnen – besonders im Bereich KI-gestützter Verteidigung. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Als größter US-Finanzkonzern profitiert JPMorgan breit von Trumps Finanzagenda – von M&A-Fantasie bis zur Kreditvergabe in der Infrastruktur. Lennar & D.R. Horton (LEN, DHI) Die beiden US-Baukonzerne könnten stark von Trumps Wohnungsbauoffensive profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten durch Einwanderungsregulierung. Deere & Company (DE) Als Hersteller von Land- und Baumaschinen ist Deere ein direkter Gewinner nationaler Infrastrukturprojekte – und könnte durch Importzölle auf ausländische Maschinen Marktanteile gewinnen. Hinweis: Diese Aktien sind spekulativer als die Top 5 – bieten aber unter Trumps politischer Agenda gezielte Chancen, vor allem im Bereich Technologie, Bau und nationale Sicherheit.","https://finment.com/boerse-aktien/us-aktien/top-donald-trump-aktien/"

Picture of Adrian Schmid Adrian Schmid | Letzte Aktualisierung am 8.04.2025 Mit seinem Zollhammer erschüttert Donald Trump die globale Wirtschaft – und die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit einem historischen Schockmoment. Seit dem 5. April 2025 gelten in den USA flächendeckende Importzölle von mindestens 10 Prozent, für Produkte aus China sogar 34 Prozent – mit der Drohung, diese um weitere 50 Prozent zu erhöhen. Diese Drohung ist bereits einen Tag später eingetreten – 104 Prozent Zölle gegen China! Die Folge? Ein Blutbad an den Börsen: Der Nasdaq stürzt in nur drei Handelstagen um über 16 Prozent ab Der S&P 500 verliert 15 Prozent Der DAX fällt sogar um 17 Prozent Rohstoffe wie WTI-Öl und Silber rauschen um bis zu 21 Prozent nach unten Der VIX explodiert auf über 60 – Angst dominiert die Wall Street Der Fear & Greed Index steht bei 4: Extreme Fear. Die Aktienmärkte stehen unter Schock – und doch: Mitten im Chaos entstehen neue Chancen. Denn während viele Exporteure, Konsumriesen und Big Tech-Aktien unter Druck geraten, profitieren andere direkt von Trumps Agenda. In diesem Artikel analysieren wir die Top 5 Donald Trump Aktien 2025 – Unternehmen, die vom neuen wirtschaftspolitischen Kurs profitieren könnten: durch nationale Investitionen, steuerliche Entlastungen und gezielte Branchenförderung. Welche Aktien könnten jetzt zur neuen Marktelite aufsteigen – und welche Rolle kann der „Trump-Turbo“ in Ihrem Depot spielen? Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt mit einem crash und börsenbeben, wahl sieg Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt / Shutterstock Donald Trumps Zollhammer 2025: So verändert der US-Präsident den Welthandel Was zunächst wie wirtschaftspolitischer Wahnsinn wirkt, folgt einer klaren Logik: US Präsident Donald Trump will die Vereinigten Staaten zur Festung der Produktion machen. Mit dem pauschalen Importzoll von mindestens 10 Prozent auf alle Waren (seit 5. April 2025) beginnt die Umsetzung seiner protektionistischen Vision einer „autarken Supermacht“. Besonders hart trifft es Länder mit hohen Handelsüberschüssen gegenüber den USA – allen voran China, das mit einer Zollbelastung von insgesamt 54 Prozent konfrontiert ist. Doch auch Deutschland, Japan, Kanada, Vietnam und die Schweiz spüren die neue Zollpolitik deutlich. Der US-Präsident hat klargemacht: Wer amerikanische Produkte blockiert oder unterbietet, zahlt den Preis. Was das bedeutet: Zollankündigung EU-Zölle: 20 Prozent Japan: 25 Prozent auf Autos, 24 Prozent auf Konsumgüter Kanada: 25 Prozent auf nicht in den USA hergestellte Autos Schweiz: 31 Prozent China: 34 Prozent + mögliche Aufstockung auf 50 Prozent Für über 40 Länder gelten Sonderzölle zwischen 30 und 50 Prozent – darunter viele asiatische und afrikanische Staaten. Gleichzeitig läuft eine 51-tägige Übergangsfrist, die bis zum 27. Mai 2025 für Waren gilt, die vor dem Stichtag verschifft wurden. Trumps strategisches Ziel: Handelsbilanz verbessern US-Produktion reindustrialisieren Abhängigkeiten von China & Europa verringern Neue Investitionsanreize im Inland schaffen Ergänzt wird der Zollhammer durch gezielte Ausnahmen für „kritische Rohstoffe und Technologien“ wie Halbleiter, Kupfer oder Arzneimittel – doch selbst diese könnten bald unter Trumps nächste Zollrunde fallen. Zwischenfazit: Trump nutzt den Zoll als geopolitisches und wirtschaftliches Werkzeug – nicht nur zur Machtdemonstration, sondern um gezielt Wachstum zurück in die USA zu zwingen. Für global aufgestellte Unternehmen ist das eine Herausforderung – für national fokussierte US-Konzerne eine historische Chance. DAX, Nasdaq & Co im freien Fall – Was jetzt nach dem Trump-Schock zählt Die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit beispielloser Wucht auf Trumps Zolloffensive – der sogenannte „Trump-Schock 2.0“ entfaltet seine volle Wucht. Innerhalb von nur drei Handelstagen erleben Anleger ein Szenario, das selbst krisenerprobte Marktteilnehmer sprachlos macht: Indizes im freien Fall Nasdaq Composite: –16 Prozent S&P 500: –15 Prozent DAX: –17 Prozent Rohstoffe brechen ein WTI-Öl: –18 Prozent Silber: –21 Prozent Panikindikatoren schlagen Alarm Volatilitätsindex VIX: springt auf über 60 Punkte – der zweithöchste Stand seit dem Corona-Crash Fear & Greed Index: fällt auf 4 von 100 – ein klares Signal für Extreme Fear Was wir erleben, ist nicht nur ein Börsenrücksetzer, sondern ein fundamentaler Stimmungsumschwung. Anleger fliehen aus Risikoassets, verkaufen Tech-Giganten und meiden exportorientierte Geschäftsmodelle. Der globale Kapitalstrom kehrt sich um – weg von Internationalisierung, hin zur nationalen Robustheit. Doch mitten im Tumult beginnt das große Umdenken: Denn während Exporteure taumeln, gewinnen andere an Stärke. US-Unternehmen mit starker Inlandsfokussierung, politischer Rückendeckung und direkter Nähe zu Trumps strategischer Agenda rücken plötzlich ins Zentrum des Anlegerinteresses. trump zoll ankündigung, sturm an den aktienmärken, handelskrieg Trump Zollkrieg / Shutterstock Was jetzt zählt: Wer liefert Stabilität im Inland? Wer profitiert von Staatsaufträgen, Deregulierung und Investitionen? Wer kann unter Trump schneller wachsen – weil die Regeln gelockert sind? Der Markt preist nicht nur Angst ein – er beginnt, neue Gewinner zu suchen. Diese Sektoren sind die neuen Gewinner unter Donald Trump – Aktien mit Potenzial Mit Zöllen, Deregulierung und milliardenschweren Investitionen hat Donald Trump die Spielregeln an der Börse neu definiert. Seine Wirtschaftspolitik belohnt nicht Internationalität, sondern strategischen Patriotismus: Wer in den USA produziert, sich auf das Heimatland fokussiert oder Trumps Agenda bedient, hat plötzlich die Nase vorn. Inmitten der Turbulenzen kristallisieren sich fünf Schlüsselbranchen heraus, die nun politisch priorisiert und finanziell begünstigt werden – und damit zu den neuen Hoffnungsträgern der Märkte avancieren könnten: 1. Verteidigung: Sicherheit wird wieder zur Aktienstory Was Trump will: Einen starken militärischen Industriekomplex. Das Verteidigungsbudget wächst um 80 Milliarden US-Dollar. Der Fokus liegt auf nationaler Unabhängigkeit, technologischem Vorsprung und militärischer Dominanz. Was die Märkte sehen: Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman und General Dynamics stehen am Anfang einer neuen Auftragswelle – von Hyperschallwaffen über Luftverteidigung bis zu autonomen Systemen. Analysten erwarten Milliardenaufträge im zweistelligen Bereich. Anlegerfazit: Planbare Umsätze, politische Priorität, hohe Eintrittsbarrieren. Verteidigung ist unter Trump kein Randthema – sie ist ein Investmenttrend. 2. Energie: Fossil wird wieder strategisch Was Trump will: Volle Energieunabhängigkeit. Öl, Gas, Kohle und Uran sollen Amerikas Grundversorgung sichern – nicht Windräder und Solarpanels aus China. Was die Märkte sehen: Exxon Mobil und Chevron profitieren von beschleunigten Genehmigungen, während Uranium Energy durch die Renaissance der Kernkraft neues Potenzial bekommt. Der Rohstoffmarkt dreht – nicht trotz, sondern wegen geopolitischer Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wachstum durch politische Rückendeckung. Trumps Energiepolitik favorisiert Konzerne mit US-Fokus und eigener Produktion. Ein Comeback fossiler Werte zeichnet sich ab. 3. Technologie & KI: Made in USA statt global Was Trump will: Die digitale Vorherrschaft der USA – unabhängig von europäischen Ethikregeln oder chinesischer Hardware. Das Stargate-Programm in Höhe von 500 Milliarden US-Dollar ist Ausdruck dieser Ambition. Was die Märkte sehen: Oracle als direkter Stargate-Partner profitiert ebenso wie Nvidia, Microsoft oder Palantir. Die Abschaffung regulatorischer Schranken könnte zusätzlich die Innovationsgeschwindigkeit erhöhen – wenn auch mit Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wer in KI investiert, investiert in die neue „digitale Infrastruktur Amerikas“. Trump verleiht dem Sektor nicht nur Budget, sondern auch narrative Schlagkraft. 4. Infrastruktur & Bau: Die Betonwende Was Trump will: Bauen, sichern, modernisieren. Straßen, Zäune, Wohnungen. Bauwirtschaft als Wachstumsanker und Jobmaschine. Was die Märkte sehen: Lennar, D.R. Horton und Caterpillar könnten von staatlichen Großprojekten profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten infolge verschärfter Immigration. Maschinenbauer wie Deere rücken ebenfalls in den Fokus. Anlegerfazit: Infrastrukturunternehmen mit US-Präsenz erhalten direkten Zugang zu Staatsaufträgen – ein klassisches Trump-Muster: Innen vor Außen. 5. Finanzen: Deregulierung Reloaded Was Trump will: Kapitalfreisetzung durch Steuererleichterungen, weniger Bürokratie und neue Anreize für M&A-Aktivitäten. Was die Märkte sehen: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan und Blackstone positionieren sich früh. Der M&A-Boom ist realistisch – ebenso wie steigende Margen im Trading und der Vermögensverwaltung. Anlegerfazit: Banken erleben ein Comeback der Deregulierung. Wer auf Transaktionen, Kreditvergabe und Asset Management setzt, könnte im Finanzsektor neue Erträge erschließen. Strategisches Zwischenfazit für Anleger: Die Politik bestimmt die Börsenordnung neu. Und Anleger, die Trumps Agenda frühzeitig verstehen, können gezielt profitieren. Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Verteidigung Aufrüstung, Sicherheit Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman Energie Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe Exxon, Chevron, Uranium Energy Technologie Stargate, KI-Förderung Oracle, Nvidia, Palanti Infrastruktur Bauprojekte, US-Subventionen Caterpillar, Lennar, D.R. Horton Finanzen Deregulierung, Steuern Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone Der Trump-Turbo für Anleger: Alternative Anlageformen wie ETFs Nicht jeder Privatanleger möchte oder kann gezielt einzelne US-Aktien auswählen, die potenziell von Trumps Politik profitieren. Eine interessante Alternative stellt hier ein Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) dar, der eine breite Streuung und Risikominderung ermöglicht. Durch den Kauf eines US-Aktien-ETFs lässt sich das Kapital auf viele amerikanische Unternehmen verteilen, wodurch man das Potenzial des gesamten US-Marktes nutzen und gleichzeitig das Risiko durch Diversifikation minimieren kann. Ein besonders attraktiver ETF für Börsianer, die am US-Markt partizipieren möchten, ist der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF (ISIN: IE00B3XXRP09). Dieser ETF bildet den S&P 500 Index ab, der die 500 größten US-Unternehmen umfasst. So können Investoren breit gestreut in die US-Wirtschaft investieren, ohne auf einzelne Aktien setzen zu müssen. Der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF hat eine Marktkapitalisierung von ca. 34,6 Milliarden USD (Stand 07.04.2025) und legt seinen Schwerpunkt auf die Branchen Technologie (33,5 Prozent), Finanzwesen (11,0 Prozent), Nicht-Basiskonsumgüter (10,8 Prozent), Gesundheitswesen (10,3 Prozent), in denen sich besonders viele Trump-begünstigte Unternehmen befinden könnten. Beispielsweise sind Schwergewichte wie Apple (7,0 Prozent), Microsoft (6,1 Prozent) und NVIDIA (6,6 Prozent) im ETF enthalten, was Anlegern Zugang zu den größten und profitabelsten Unternehmen der USA verschafft. Der ETF überzeugt zudem durch niedrige Gebühren: Die Gesamtkostenquote (Total Expense Ratio, TER) liegt bei nur 0,07 Prozent pro Jahr. Dividenden werden quartalsweise ausgeschüttet, wie zuletzt im März 2025 (0,30 USD je Anteil), was Anlegern einen zusätzlichen Ertrag ermöglicht. Trotz der attraktiven Möglichkeiten, die ein US-Aktien ETF wie der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF bietet, sollten Anleger jedoch darauf achten, nicht ihr gesamtes Kapital ausschließlich in den US-Markt zu investieren. ETFs auf internationale Märkte können helfen, die Volatilität zu reduzieren und das Risiko weiter zu streuen. Weitere ETFs für Ihren Vermögensaufbau finden Sie hier Beste ETFs.

In mehreren Reden betonte er, dass die militärische Überlegenheit der USA „wieder höchste Priorität“ habe. Lockheed Martin ist bereits heute mit über 70 Prozent seines Umsatzes vom US-Militär abhängig – und dürfte damit direkt von den neuen Großaufträgen profitieren. Im Fokus: Neue F-35-Serien Hyperschall-Raketen (Prompt Strike) Raumfahrtprogramme autonome Überwachungs- und Abwehrsysteme Strategischer Trumpf: Technologischer Vorsprung Trumps Regierung will die Abhängigkeit von ausländischer Verteidigungstechnik reduzieren und verstärkt auf nationale Beschaffung setzen. Als führender Anbieter von High-End-Systemen genießt Lockheed Martin hier eine herausragende Position – technologisch, politisch und organisatorisch.

Für Exxon Mobil bedeutet das konkret: Schnellere und günstigere Produktionsfreigaben Neue Infrastrukturprojekte wie Pipelines und Terminals Steuererleichterungen und Subventionen auf Bundesebene Rückzug aus klimapolitischen Verpflichtungen (Pariser Abkommen) Gleichzeitig erhöht sich der politische Druck auf erneuerbare Energien – was die Marktposition klassischer Öl- und Gasunternehmen zusätzlich stärkt.

Caterpillar Aktie: Infrastruktur-Maschine für Trumps Bauoffensive Caterpillar Inc. (ISIN: US1491231015 – Symbol: CAT – Währung: USD) Caterpillar ist der weltweit führende Hersteller von Baumaschinen, Diesel- und Gasmotoren, Industrieanlagen sowie Minenequipment. Das Unternehmen mit Sitz in Illinois gilt als konjunktursensitiver Schwergewichtsindex im US-Industriesektor – und ist eine Bau- und Infrastruktur-Aktie par excellence, mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 138 Milliarden US-Dollar (Stand: April 2025). Trumps Infrastrukturpolitik: America Builds Again Donald Trump hat bereits in seiner ersten Amtszeit Infrastrukturprojekte als zentrales Element seiner Wirtschaftspolitik propagiert – doch erst 2025 werden die Pläne massiv umgesetzt. Die neue Regierung kündigte ein 1-Billionen-US-Dollar-Programm zur Modernisierung von Straßen, Brücken, Pipelines und Energieinfrastruktur an. Caterpillar profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Staatliche Nachfrage nach Bau- und Erdbewegungsmaschinen Erleichterte Umweltauflagen für Bauprojekte Stärkung nationaler Lieferketten – Vorteil für US-Produktion Steuervorteile für Investitionen in Maschinen & Ausrüstung Fundamentale Entwicklung und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 67,1 Mrd. USD 71,5 Mrd. USD 75,2 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 9,2 Mrd. USD 10,0 Mrd. USD 10,6 Mrd. USD KGV (2025e) ca. 15 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 2,0 % Caterpillar ist nicht nur profitabel, sondern auch cashflow-stark. Die Nachfrage im US-Markt ist robust, die Book-to-Bill-Ratio in den Bereichen Bau & Mining liegt über 1 – ein Zeichen für solides Wachstum. Zusatztreiber: Deglobalisierung & Rohstoffwende Die protektionistische Handelspolitik der Trump-Regierung wirkt indirekt positiv auf Caterpillar. Denn mit steigenden Zöllen auf Maschinenimporte aus Europa und Asien gewinnen US-Produzenten an Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Gleichzeitig befeuert die globale Unsicherheit Investitionen in Energie- und Rohstoffgewinnung – ein weiteres Standbein für Caterpillar. Anlegerfazit: Realwirtschaftlicher Trump-Profiteur mit Substanz Caterpillar ist kein spekulativer Highflyer, sondern ein solider Konjunkturzykliker mit politischem Rückenwind. Wer auf reale Infrastrukturinvestitionen, Cashflows und US-zentriertes Wachstum setzen will, findet hier eine Trump-Aktie mit Substanz.

Oracle ist – neben OpenAI und Softbank – einer der zentralen Technologiepartner. Was das konkret bedeutet: Großaufträge für Rechenzentren und Cloud-Kapazitäten Politische Unterstützung für inländische Datenverarbeitung Wegfall ethischer KI-Regulierung = höhere Innovationsgeschwindigkeit Positionierung als „Sicherheitsanbieter“ im Sinne nationaler Datensouveränität Oracle bringt mit seiner eigenen Cloud-Plattform (OCI – Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) und den weltweit genutzten Datenbanksystemen genau die Fähigkeiten mit, die jetzt politisch gewollt sind: schnell skalierbare Systeme, US-basiert und unter Kontrolle der Regierungspartner.

Regulatorische Auflagen aus der Dodd-Frank-Ära werden gelockert oder gestrichen, Kapitalvorgaben gelockert und steuerliche Anreize für Fusionen und Übernahmen geschaffen. Goldman profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Mehr Spielraum für profitable Eigenhandelsgeschäfte Neue Impulse im M&A-Geschäft – vor allem bei US-Konzernen Wachstum im Asset Management durch steuerbegünstigte Anlagevehikel Repatriierung von Kapital – stärkere US-Fokus-Strategien Die Bank hat bereits signalisiert, ihre M&A-Kapazitäten 2025 auszubauen und erwartet eine Zunahme von IPOs sowie Restrukturierungen in Industrie, Tech und Healthcare.

Anlegerfazit: Profiteur der Freiheit – und der Transaktionen Goldman Sachs zählt zu den wirtschaftspolitischen Hauptprofiteuren der Trump-Administration. Die Mischung aus politischem Rückenwind, strukturellem Wachstumsfeld (M&A, Private Equity) und starker Profitabilität macht die Aktie zu einem strategischen Trump-Investment im Finanzsektor.

Die Auswirkungen auf die Börse sind deutlich spürbar: Während exportorientierte Unternehmen, Konsumgüterkonzerne und global vernetzte Tech-Riesen unter Druck geraten, entstehen neue Gewinner in Bereichen, die Trump politisch priorisiert.

BONUS: Trump-Watchlist 2025 – Diese Aktien könnten ebenfalls profitieren Nicht alle Trump-Profiteure haben es in die Top 5 geschafft – doch einige spannende Kandidaten verdienen dennoch einen Platz auf Ihrer Watchlist: Tesla (TSLA) Elon Musk steht Trump politisch überraschend nahe. Sollte Tesla von steuerlichen Erleichterungen, Inlandsproduktion und Infrastrukturprojekten profitieren, könnte die Aktie ungeahnt Rückenwind erhalten – auch ohne direkte Beteiligung am Stargate-Programm. Palantir (PLTR) Das Datenanalyse-Unternehmen mit starken Regierungsbeziehungen könnte im Zuge wachsender Sicherheitsausgaben und nationaler IT-Projekte zusätzliche Aufträge gewinnen – besonders im Bereich KI-gestützter Verteidigung. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Als größter US-Finanzkonzern profitiert JPMorgan breit von Trumps Finanzagenda – von M&A-Fantasie bis zur Kreditvergabe in der Infrastruktur. Lennar & D.R. Horton (LEN, DHI) Die beiden US-Baukonzerne könnten stark von Trumps Wohnungsbauoffensive profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten durch Einwanderungsregulierung. Deere & Company (DE) Als Hersteller von Land- und Baumaschinen ist Deere ein direkter Gewinner nationaler Infrastrukturprojekte – und könnte durch Importzölle auf ausländische Maschinen Marktanteile gewinnen. Hinweis: Diese Aktien sind spekulativer als die Top 5 – bieten aber unter Trumps politischer Agenda gezielte Chancen, vor allem im Bereich Technologie, Bau und nationale Sicherheit.","https://finment.com/boerse-aktien/us-aktien/top-donald-trump-aktien/"

Picture of Adrian Schmid Adrian Schmid | Letzte Aktualisierung am 8.04.2025 Mit seinem Zollhammer erschüttert Donald Trump die globale Wirtschaft – und die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit einem historischen Schockmoment. Seit dem 5. April 2025 gelten in den USA flächendeckende Importzölle von mindestens 10 Prozent, für Produkte aus China sogar 34 Prozent – mit der Drohung, diese um weitere 50 Prozent zu erhöhen. Diese Drohung ist bereits einen Tag später eingetreten – 104 Prozent Zölle gegen China! Die Folge? Ein Blutbad an den Börsen: Der Nasdaq stürzt in nur drei Handelstagen um über 16 Prozent ab Der S&P 500 verliert 15 Prozent Der DAX fällt sogar um 17 Prozent Rohstoffe wie WTI-Öl und Silber rauschen um bis zu 21 Prozent nach unten Der VIX explodiert auf über 60 – Angst dominiert die Wall Street Der Fear & Greed Index steht bei 4: Extreme Fear. Die Aktienmärkte stehen unter Schock – und doch: Mitten im Chaos entstehen neue Chancen. Denn während viele Exporteure, Konsumriesen und Big Tech-Aktien unter Druck geraten, profitieren andere direkt von Trumps Agenda. In diesem Artikel analysieren wir die Top 5 Donald Trump Aktien 2025 – Unternehmen, die vom neuen wirtschaftspolitischen Kurs profitieren könnten: durch nationale Investitionen, steuerliche Entlastungen und gezielte Branchenförderung. Welche Aktien könnten jetzt zur neuen Marktelite aufsteigen – und welche Rolle kann der „Trump-Turbo“ in Ihrem Depot spielen? Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt mit einem crash und börsenbeben, wahl sieg Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt / Shutterstock Donald Trumps Zollhammer 2025: So verändert der US-Präsident den Welthandel Was zunächst wie wirtschaftspolitischer Wahnsinn wirkt, folgt einer klaren Logik: US Präsident Donald Trump will die Vereinigten Staaten zur Festung der Produktion machen. Mit dem pauschalen Importzoll von mindestens 10 Prozent auf alle Waren (seit 5. April 2025) beginnt die Umsetzung seiner protektionistischen Vision einer „autarken Supermacht“. Besonders hart trifft es Länder mit hohen Handelsüberschüssen gegenüber den USA – allen voran China, das mit einer Zollbelastung von insgesamt 54 Prozent konfrontiert ist. Doch auch Deutschland, Japan, Kanada, Vietnam und die Schweiz spüren die neue Zollpolitik deutlich. Der US-Präsident hat klargemacht: Wer amerikanische Produkte blockiert oder unterbietet, zahlt den Preis. Was das bedeutet: Zollankündigung EU-Zölle: 20 Prozent Japan: 25 Prozent auf Autos, 24 Prozent auf Konsumgüter Kanada: 25 Prozent auf nicht in den USA hergestellte Autos Schweiz: 31 Prozent China: 34 Prozent + mögliche Aufstockung auf 50 Prozent Für über 40 Länder gelten Sonderzölle zwischen 30 und 50 Prozent – darunter viele asiatische und afrikanische Staaten. Gleichzeitig läuft eine 51-tägige Übergangsfrist, die bis zum 27. Mai 2025 für Waren gilt, die vor dem Stichtag verschifft wurden. Trumps strategisches Ziel: Handelsbilanz verbessern US-Produktion reindustrialisieren Abhängigkeiten von China & Europa verringern Neue Investitionsanreize im Inland schaffen Ergänzt wird der Zollhammer durch gezielte Ausnahmen für „kritische Rohstoffe und Technologien“ wie Halbleiter, Kupfer oder Arzneimittel – doch selbst diese könnten bald unter Trumps nächste Zollrunde fallen. Zwischenfazit: Trump nutzt den Zoll als geopolitisches und wirtschaftliches Werkzeug – nicht nur zur Machtdemonstration, sondern um gezielt Wachstum zurück in die USA zu zwingen. Für global aufgestellte Unternehmen ist das eine Herausforderung – für national fokussierte US-Konzerne eine historische Chance. DAX, Nasdaq & Co im freien Fall – Was jetzt nach dem Trump-Schock zählt Die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit beispielloser Wucht auf Trumps Zolloffensive – der sogenannte „Trump-Schock 2.0“ entfaltet seine volle Wucht. Innerhalb von nur drei Handelstagen erleben Anleger ein Szenario, das selbst krisenerprobte Marktteilnehmer sprachlos macht: Indizes im freien Fall Nasdaq Composite: –16 Prozent S&P 500: –15 Prozent DAX: –17 Prozent Rohstoffe brechen ein WTI-Öl: –18 Prozent Silber: –21 Prozent Panikindikatoren schlagen Alarm Volatilitätsindex VIX: springt auf über 60 Punkte – der zweithöchste Stand seit dem Corona-Crash Fear & Greed Index: fällt auf 4 von 100 – ein klares Signal für Extreme Fear Was wir erleben, ist nicht nur ein Börsenrücksetzer, sondern ein fundamentaler Stimmungsumschwung. Anleger fliehen aus Risikoassets, verkaufen Tech-Giganten und meiden exportorientierte Geschäftsmodelle. Der globale Kapitalstrom kehrt sich um – weg von Internationalisierung, hin zur nationalen Robustheit. Doch mitten im Tumult beginnt das große Umdenken: Denn während Exporteure taumeln, gewinnen andere an Stärke. US-Unternehmen mit starker Inlandsfokussierung, politischer Rückendeckung und direkter Nähe zu Trumps strategischer Agenda rücken plötzlich ins Zentrum des Anlegerinteresses. trump zoll ankündigung, sturm an den aktienmärken, handelskrieg Trump Zollkrieg / Shutterstock Was jetzt zählt: Wer liefert Stabilität im Inland? Wer profitiert von Staatsaufträgen, Deregulierung und Investitionen? Wer kann unter Trump schneller wachsen – weil die Regeln gelockert sind? Der Markt preist nicht nur Angst ein – er beginnt, neue Gewinner zu suchen. Diese Sektoren sind die neuen Gewinner unter Donald Trump – Aktien mit Potenzial Mit Zöllen, Deregulierung und milliardenschweren Investitionen hat Donald Trump die Spielregeln an der Börse neu definiert. Seine Wirtschaftspolitik belohnt nicht Internationalität, sondern strategischen Patriotismus: Wer in den USA produziert, sich auf das Heimatland fokussiert oder Trumps Agenda bedient, hat plötzlich die Nase vorn. Inmitten der Turbulenzen kristallisieren sich fünf Schlüsselbranchen heraus, die nun politisch priorisiert und finanziell begünstigt werden – und damit zu den neuen Hoffnungsträgern der Märkte avancieren könnten: 1. Verteidigung: Sicherheit wird wieder zur Aktienstory Was Trump will: Einen starken militärischen Industriekomplex. Das Verteidigungsbudget wächst um 80 Milliarden US-Dollar. Der Fokus liegt auf nationaler Unabhängigkeit, technologischem Vorsprung und militärischer Dominanz. Was die Märkte sehen: Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman und General Dynamics stehen am Anfang einer neuen Auftragswelle – von Hyperschallwaffen über Luftverteidigung bis zu autonomen Systemen. Analysten erwarten Milliardenaufträge im zweistelligen Bereich. Anlegerfazit: Planbare Umsätze, politische Priorität, hohe Eintrittsbarrieren. Verteidigung ist unter Trump kein Randthema – sie ist ein Investmenttrend. 2. Energie: Fossil wird wieder strategisch Was Trump will: Volle Energieunabhängigkeit. Öl, Gas, Kohle und Uran sollen Amerikas Grundversorgung sichern – nicht Windräder und Solarpanels aus China. Was die Märkte sehen: Exxon Mobil und Chevron profitieren von beschleunigten Genehmigungen, während Uranium Energy durch die Renaissance der Kernkraft neues Potenzial bekommt. Der Rohstoffmarkt dreht – nicht trotz, sondern wegen geopolitischer Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wachstum durch politische Rückendeckung. Trumps Energiepolitik favorisiert Konzerne mit US-Fokus und eigener Produktion. Ein Comeback fossiler Werte zeichnet sich ab. 3. Technologie & KI: Made in USA statt global Was Trump will: Die digitale Vorherrschaft der USA – unabhängig von europäischen Ethikregeln oder chinesischer Hardware. Das Stargate-Programm in Höhe von 500 Milliarden US-Dollar ist Ausdruck dieser Ambition. Was die Märkte sehen: Oracle als direkter Stargate-Partner profitiert ebenso wie Nvidia, Microsoft oder Palantir. Die Abschaffung regulatorischer Schranken könnte zusätzlich die Innovationsgeschwindigkeit erhöhen – wenn auch mit Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wer in KI investiert, investiert in die neue „digitale Infrastruktur Amerikas“. Trump verleiht dem Sektor nicht nur Budget, sondern auch narrative Schlagkraft. 4. Infrastruktur & Bau: Die Betonwende Was Trump will: Bauen, sichern, modernisieren. Straßen, Zäune, Wohnungen. Bauwirtschaft als Wachstumsanker und Jobmaschine. Was die Märkte sehen: Lennar, D.R. Horton und Caterpillar könnten von staatlichen Großprojekten profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten infolge verschärfter Immigration. Maschinenbauer wie Deere rücken ebenfalls in den Fokus. Anlegerfazit: Infrastrukturunternehmen mit US-Präsenz erhalten direkten Zugang zu Staatsaufträgen – ein klassisches Trump-Muster: Innen vor Außen. 5. Finanzen: Deregulierung Reloaded Was Trump will: Kapitalfreisetzung durch Steuererleichterungen, weniger Bürokratie und neue Anreize für M&A-Aktivitäten. Was die Märkte sehen: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan und Blackstone positionieren sich früh. Der M&A-Boom ist realistisch – ebenso wie steigende Margen im Trading und der Vermögensverwaltung. Anlegerfazit: Banken erleben ein Comeback der Deregulierung. Wer auf Transaktionen, Kreditvergabe und Asset Management setzt, könnte im Finanzsektor neue Erträge erschließen. Strategisches Zwischenfazit für Anleger: Die Politik bestimmt die Börsenordnung neu. Und Anleger, die Trumps Agenda frühzeitig verstehen, können gezielt profitieren. Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Verteidigung Aufrüstung, Sicherheit Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman Energie Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe Exxon, Chevron, Uranium Energy Technologie Stargate, KI-Förderung Oracle, Nvidia, Palanti Infrastruktur Bauprojekte, US-Subventionen Caterpillar, Lennar, D.R. Horton Finanzen Deregulierung, Steuern Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone Der Trump-Turbo für Anleger: Alternative Anlageformen wie ETFs Nicht jeder Privatanleger möchte oder kann gezielt einzelne US-Aktien auswählen, die potenziell von Trumps Politik profitieren. Eine interessante Alternative stellt hier ein Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) dar, der eine breite Streuung und Risikominderung ermöglicht. Durch den Kauf eines US-Aktien-ETFs lässt sich das Kapital auf viele amerikanische Unternehmen verteilen, wodurch man das Potenzial des gesamten US-Marktes nutzen und gleichzeitig das Risiko durch Diversifikation minimieren kann. Ein besonders attraktiver ETF für Börsianer, die am US-Markt partizipieren möchten, ist der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF (ISIN: IE00B3XXRP09). Dieser ETF bildet den S&P 500 Index ab, der die 500 größten US-Unternehmen umfasst. So können Investoren breit gestreut in die US-Wirtschaft investieren, ohne auf einzelne Aktien setzen zu müssen. Der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF hat eine Marktkapitalisierung von ca. 34,6 Milliarden USD (Stand 07.04.2025) und legt seinen Schwerpunkt auf die Branchen Technologie (33,5 Prozent), Finanzwesen (11,0 Prozent), Nicht-Basiskonsumgüter (10,8 Prozent), Gesundheitswesen (10,3 Prozent), in denen sich besonders viele Trump-begünstigte Unternehmen befinden könnten. Beispielsweise sind Schwergewichte wie Apple (7,0 Prozent), Microsoft (6,1 Prozent) und NVIDIA (6,6 Prozent) im ETF enthalten, was Anlegern Zugang zu den größten und profitabelsten Unternehmen der USA verschafft. Der ETF überzeugt zudem durch niedrige Gebühren: Die Gesamtkostenquote (Total Expense Ratio, TER) liegt bei nur 0,07 Prozent pro Jahr. Dividenden werden quartalsweise ausgeschüttet, wie zuletzt im März 2025 (0,30 USD je Anteil), was Anlegern einen zusätzlichen Ertrag ermöglicht. Trotz der attraktiven Möglichkeiten, die ein US-Aktien ETF wie der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF bietet, sollten Anleger jedoch darauf achten, nicht ihr gesamtes Kapital ausschließlich in den US-Markt zu investieren. ETFs auf internationale Märkte können helfen, die Volatilität zu reduzieren und das Risiko weiter zu streuen. Weitere ETFs für Ihren Vermögensaufbau finden Sie hier Beste ETFs.

In mehreren Reden betonte er, dass die militärische Überlegenheit der USA „wieder höchste Priorität“ habe. Lockheed Martin ist bereits heute mit über 70 Prozent seines Umsatzes vom US-Militär abhängig – und dürfte damit direkt von den neuen Großaufträgen profitieren. Im Fokus: Neue F-35-Serien Hyperschall-Raketen (Prompt Strike) Raumfahrtprogramme autonome Überwachungs- und Abwehrsysteme Strategischer Trumpf: Technologischer Vorsprung Trumps Regierung will die Abhängigkeit von ausländischer Verteidigungstechnik reduzieren und verstärkt auf nationale Beschaffung setzen. Als führender Anbieter von High-End-Systemen genießt Lockheed Martin hier eine herausragende Position – technologisch, politisch und organisatorisch.

Exxon Mobil Aktie: Neue Chancen durch Trumps Energiepolitik Exxon Mobil Corporation (ISIN: US30231G1022 – Symbol: XOM – Währung: USD) Die Exxon Mobil Corporation, mit Hauptsitz in Irving, Texas, ist eines der weltweit führenden Unternehmen in der Öl- und Gasindustrie. Das Unternehmen deckt die gesamte Wertschöpfungskette ab – von der Exploration über die Produktion bis hin zur Raffination und dem Vertrieb von Erdöl und Erdgas. Die Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „XOM“ gehandelt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 453 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) gehört Exxon Mobil zu den Schwergewichten im Energiesektor und hat eine herausragende Position auf dem globalen Markt. Trumps Energieagenda: Förderung statt Verzicht Donald Trump hat nach seiner Amtseinführung einen nationalen Energienotstand ausgerufen und der Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe höchste Priorität eingeräumt. Genehmigungsverfahren wurden vereinfacht, Umweltstandards gelockert und neue Bohrlizenzen im Offshore-Bereich freigegeben. Für Exxon Mobil bedeutet das konkret: Schnellere und günstigere Produktionsfreigaben Neue Infrastrukturprojekte wie Pipelines und Terminals Steuererleichterungen und Subventionen auf Bundesebene Rückzug aus klimapolitischen Verpflichtungen (Pariser Abkommen) Gleichzeitig erhöht sich der politische Druck auf erneuerbare Energien – was die Marktposition klassischer Öl- und Gasunternehmen zusätzlich stärkt.

Analysten sehen im Umfeld steigender globaler Nachfrage und nationaler Förderung weiteres Kurspotenzial. Anlegerfazit: Fossiler Champion mit politischem Schutzschild Exxon Mobil zählt zu den größten Gewinnern der neuen Energiepolitik in den USA. Der politische Rückenwind verstärkt die operative Stärke des Konzerns und macht ihn zu einem potenziellen Dauerläufer – auch in einem volatilen Marktumfeld.

Trumps Infrastrukturpolitik: America Builds Again Donald Trump hat bereits in seiner ersten Amtszeit Infrastrukturprojekte als zentrales Element seiner Wirtschaftspolitik propagiert – doch erst 2025 werden die Pläne massiv umgesetzt. Die neue Regierung kündigte ein 1-Billionen-US-Dollar-Programm zur Modernisierung von Straßen, Brücken, Pipelines und Energieinfrastruktur an. Caterpillar profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Staatliche Nachfrage nach Bau- und Erdbewegungsmaschinen Erleichterte Umweltauflagen für Bauprojekte Stärkung nationaler Lieferketten – Vorteil für US-Produktion Steuervorteile für Investitionen in Maschinen & Ausrüstung Fundamentale Entwicklung und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 67,1 Mrd. USD 71,5 Mrd. USD 75,2 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 9,2 Mrd. USD 10,0 Mrd. USD 10,6 Mrd. USD KGV (2025e) ca. 15 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 2,0 % Caterpillar ist nicht nur profitabel, sondern auch cashflow-stark. Die Nachfrage im US-Markt ist robust, die Book-to-Bill-Ratio in den Bereichen Bau & Mining liegt über 1 – ein Zeichen für solides Wachstum. Zusatztreiber: Deglobalisierung & Rohstoffwende Die protektionistische Handelspolitik der Trump-Regierung wirkt indirekt positiv auf Caterpillar. Denn mit steigenden Zöllen auf Maschinenimporte aus Europa und Asien gewinnen US-Produzenten an Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Gleichzeitig befeuert die globale Unsicherheit Investitionen in Energie- und Rohstoffgewinnung – ein weiteres Standbein für Caterpillar. Anlegerfazit: Realwirtschaftlicher Trump-Profiteur mit Substanz Caterpillar ist kein spekulativer Highflyer, sondern ein solider Konjunkturzykliker mit politischem Rückenwind. Wer auf reale Infrastrukturinvestitionen, Cashflows und US-zentriertes Wachstum setzen will, findet hier eine Trump-Aktie mit Substanz. Trump-Faktor: Hoch Risiken: Zinssensitivität, Projektverzögerungen Chancen: Staatsaufträge, Investitionsdynamik, Subventionsvorteile Caterpillar Aktienchart 2021 – 2025 / FinMent 2.

Stargate: 500 Milliarden US-Dollar für Amerikas KI-Zukunft Donald Trump hat unmittelbar nach Amtsantritt ein Investitionsprogramm in Höhe von 500 Milliarden US-Dollar angekündigt, das den Ausbau der nationalen KI-Infrastruktur beschleunigen soll. Oracle ist – neben OpenAI und Softbank – einer der zentralen Technologiepartner. Was das konkret bedeutet: Großaufträge für Rechenzentren und Cloud-Kapazitäten Politische Unterstützung für inländische Datenverarbeitung Wegfall ethischer KI-Regulierung = höhere Innovationsgeschwindigkeit Positionierung als „Sicherheitsanbieter“ im Sinne nationaler Datensouveränität Oracle bringt mit seiner eigenen Cloud-Plattform (OCI – Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) und den weltweit genutzten Datenbanksystemen genau die Fähigkeiten mit, die jetzt politisch gewollt sind: schnell skalierbare Systeme, US-basiert und unter Kontrolle der Regierungspartner.

Regulatorische Auflagen aus der Dodd-Frank-Ära werden gelockert oder gestrichen, Kapitalvorgaben gelockert und steuerliche Anreize für Fusionen und Übernahmen geschaffen. Goldman profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Mehr Spielraum für profitable Eigenhandelsgeschäfte Neue Impulse im M&A-Geschäft – vor allem bei US-Konzernen Wachstum im Asset Management durch steuerbegünstigte Anlagevehikel Repatriierung von Kapital – stärkere US-Fokus-Strategien Die Bank hat bereits signalisiert, ihre M&A-Kapazitäten 2025 auszubauen und erwartet eine Zunahme von IPOs sowie Restrukturierungen in Industrie, Tech und Healthcare.

Anlegerfazit: Profiteur der Freiheit – und der Transaktionen Goldman Sachs zählt zu den wirtschaftspolitischen Hauptprofiteuren der Trump-Administration. Die Mischung aus politischem Rückenwind, strukturellem Wachstumsfeld (M&A, Private Equity) und starker Profitabilität macht die Aktie zu einem strategischen Trump-Investment im Finanzsektor.

BONUS: Trump-Watchlist 2025 – Diese Aktien könnten ebenfalls profitieren Nicht alle Trump-Profiteure haben es in die Top 5 geschafft – doch einige spannende Kandidaten verdienen dennoch einen Platz auf Ihrer Watchlist: Tesla (TSLA) Elon Musk steht Trump politisch überraschend nahe. Sollte Tesla von steuerlichen Erleichterungen, Inlandsproduktion und Infrastrukturprojekten profitieren, könnte die Aktie ungeahnt Rückenwind erhalten – auch ohne direkte Beteiligung am Stargate-Programm. Palantir (PLTR) Das Datenanalyse-Unternehmen mit starken Regierungsbeziehungen könnte im Zuge wachsender Sicherheitsausgaben und nationaler IT-Projekte zusätzliche Aufträge gewinnen – besonders im Bereich KI-gestützter Verteidigung. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Als größter US-Finanzkonzern profitiert JPMorgan breit von Trumps Finanzagenda – von M&A-Fantasie bis zur Kreditvergabe in der Infrastruktur. Lennar & D.R. Horton (LEN, DHI) Die beiden US-Baukonzerne könnten stark von Trumps Wohnungsbauoffensive profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten durch Einwanderungsregulierung. Deere & Company (DE) Als Hersteller von Land- und Baumaschinen ist Deere ein direkter Gewinner nationaler Infrastrukturprojekte – und könnte durch Importzölle auf ausländische Maschinen Marktanteile gewinnen. Hinweis: Diese Aktien sind spekulativer als die Top 5 – bieten aber unter Trumps politischer Agenda gezielte Chancen, vor allem im Bereich Technologie, Bau und nationale Sicherheit.","https://finment.com/boerse-aktien/us-aktien/top-donald-trump-aktien/"

Picture of Adrian Schmid Adrian Schmid | Letzte Aktualisierung am 8.04.2025 Mit seinem Zollhammer erschüttert Donald Trump die globale Wirtschaft – und die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit einem historischen Schockmoment. Seit dem 5. April 2025 gelten in den USA flächendeckende Importzölle von mindestens 10 Prozent, für Produkte aus China sogar 34 Prozent – mit der Drohung, diese um weitere 50 Prozent zu erhöhen. Diese Drohung ist bereits einen Tag später eingetreten – 104 Prozent Zölle gegen China! Die Folge? Ein Blutbad an den Börsen: Der Nasdaq stürzt in nur drei Handelstagen um über 16 Prozent ab Der S&P 500 verliert 15 Prozent Der DAX fällt sogar um 17 Prozent Rohstoffe wie WTI-Öl und Silber rauschen um bis zu 21 Prozent nach unten Der VIX explodiert auf über 60 – Angst dominiert die Wall Street Der Fear & Greed Index steht bei 4: Extreme Fear. Die Aktienmärkte stehen unter Schock – und doch: Mitten im Chaos entstehen neue Chancen. Denn während viele Exporteure, Konsumriesen und Big Tech-Aktien unter Druck geraten, profitieren andere direkt von Trumps Agenda. In diesem Artikel analysieren wir die Top 5 Donald Trump Aktien 2025 – Unternehmen, die vom neuen wirtschaftspolitischen Kurs profitieren könnten: durch nationale Investitionen, steuerliche Entlastungen und gezielte Branchenförderung. Welche Aktien könnten jetzt zur neuen Marktelite aufsteigen – und welche Rolle kann der „Trump-Turbo“ in Ihrem Depot spielen? Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt mit einem crash und börsenbeben, wahl sieg Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt / Shutterstock Donald Trumps Zollhammer 2025: So verändert der US-Präsident den Welthandel Was zunächst wie wirtschaftspolitischer Wahnsinn wirkt, folgt einer klaren Logik: US Präsident Donald Trump will die Vereinigten Staaten zur Festung der Produktion machen. Mit dem pauschalen Importzoll von mindestens 10 Prozent auf alle Waren (seit 5. April 2025) beginnt die Umsetzung seiner protektionistischen Vision einer „autarken Supermacht“. Besonders hart trifft es Länder mit hohen Handelsüberschüssen gegenüber den USA – allen voran China, das mit einer Zollbelastung von insgesamt 54 Prozent konfrontiert ist. Doch auch Deutschland, Japan, Kanada, Vietnam und die Schweiz spüren die neue Zollpolitik deutlich. Der US-Präsident hat klargemacht: Wer amerikanische Produkte blockiert oder unterbietet, zahlt den Preis. Was das bedeutet: Zollankündigung EU-Zölle: 20 Prozent Japan: 25 Prozent auf Autos, 24 Prozent auf Konsumgüter Kanada: 25 Prozent auf nicht in den USA hergestellte Autos Schweiz: 31 Prozent China: 34 Prozent + mögliche Aufstockung auf 50 Prozent Für über 40 Länder gelten Sonderzölle zwischen 30 und 50 Prozent – darunter viele asiatische und afrikanische Staaten. Gleichzeitig läuft eine 51-tägige Übergangsfrist, die bis zum 27. Mai 2025 für Waren gilt, die vor dem Stichtag verschifft wurden. Trumps strategisches Ziel: Handelsbilanz verbessern US-Produktion reindustrialisieren Abhängigkeiten von China & Europa verringern Neue Investitionsanreize im Inland schaffen Ergänzt wird der Zollhammer durch gezielte Ausnahmen für „kritische Rohstoffe und Technologien“ wie Halbleiter, Kupfer oder Arzneimittel – doch selbst diese könnten bald unter Trumps nächste Zollrunde fallen. Zwischenfazit: Trump nutzt den Zoll als geopolitisches und wirtschaftliches Werkzeug – nicht nur zur Machtdemonstration, sondern um gezielt Wachstum zurück in die USA zu zwingen. Für global aufgestellte Unternehmen ist das eine Herausforderung – für national fokussierte US-Konzerne eine historische Chance. DAX, Nasdaq & Co im freien Fall – Was jetzt nach dem Trump-Schock zählt Die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit beispielloser Wucht auf Trumps Zolloffensive – der sogenannte „Trump-Schock 2.0“ entfaltet seine volle Wucht. Innerhalb von nur drei Handelstagen erleben Anleger ein Szenario, das selbst krisenerprobte Marktteilnehmer sprachlos macht: Indizes im freien Fall Nasdaq Composite: –16 Prozent S&P 500: –15 Prozent DAX: –17 Prozent Rohstoffe brechen ein WTI-Öl: –18 Prozent Silber: –21 Prozent Panikindikatoren schlagen Alarm Volatilitätsindex VIX: springt auf über 60 Punkte – der zweithöchste Stand seit dem Corona-Crash Fear & Greed Index: fällt auf 4 von 100 – ein klares Signal für Extreme Fear Was wir erleben, ist nicht nur ein Börsenrücksetzer, sondern ein fundamentaler Stimmungsumschwung. Anleger fliehen aus Risikoassets, verkaufen Tech-Giganten und meiden exportorientierte Geschäftsmodelle. Der globale Kapitalstrom kehrt sich um – weg von Internationalisierung, hin zur nationalen Robustheit. Doch mitten im Tumult beginnt das große Umdenken: Denn während Exporteure taumeln, gewinnen andere an Stärke. US-Unternehmen mit starker Inlandsfokussierung, politischer Rückendeckung und direkter Nähe zu Trumps strategischer Agenda rücken plötzlich ins Zentrum des Anlegerinteresses. trump zoll ankündigung, sturm an den aktienmärken, handelskrieg Trump Zollkrieg / Shutterstock Was jetzt zählt: Wer liefert Stabilität im Inland? Wer profitiert von Staatsaufträgen, Deregulierung und Investitionen? Wer kann unter Trump schneller wachsen – weil die Regeln gelockert sind? Der Markt preist nicht nur Angst ein – er beginnt, neue Gewinner zu suchen. Diese Sektoren sind die neuen Gewinner unter Donald Trump – Aktien mit Potenzial Mit Zöllen, Deregulierung und milliardenschweren Investitionen hat Donald Trump die Spielregeln an der Börse neu definiert. Seine Wirtschaftspolitik belohnt nicht Internationalität, sondern strategischen Patriotismus: Wer in den USA produziert, sich auf das Heimatland fokussiert oder Trumps Agenda bedient, hat plötzlich die Nase vorn. Inmitten der Turbulenzen kristallisieren sich fünf Schlüsselbranchen heraus, die nun politisch priorisiert und finanziell begünstigt werden – und damit zu den neuen Hoffnungsträgern der Märkte avancieren könnten: 1. Verteidigung: Sicherheit wird wieder zur Aktienstory Was Trump will: Einen starken militärischen Industriekomplex. Das Verteidigungsbudget wächst um 80 Milliarden US-Dollar. Der Fokus liegt auf nationaler Unabhängigkeit, technologischem Vorsprung und militärischer Dominanz. Was die Märkte sehen: Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman und General Dynamics stehen am Anfang einer neuen Auftragswelle – von Hyperschallwaffen über Luftverteidigung bis zu autonomen Systemen. Analysten erwarten Milliardenaufträge im zweistelligen Bereich. Anlegerfazit: Planbare Umsätze, politische Priorität, hohe Eintrittsbarrieren. Verteidigung ist unter Trump kein Randthema – sie ist ein Investmenttrend. 2. Energie: Fossil wird wieder strategisch Was Trump will: Volle Energieunabhängigkeit. Öl, Gas, Kohle und Uran sollen Amerikas Grundversorgung sichern – nicht Windräder und Solarpanels aus China. Was die Märkte sehen: Exxon Mobil und Chevron profitieren von beschleunigten Genehmigungen, während Uranium Energy durch die Renaissance der Kernkraft neues Potenzial bekommt. Der Rohstoffmarkt dreht – nicht trotz, sondern wegen geopolitischer Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wachstum durch politische Rückendeckung. Trumps Energiepolitik favorisiert Konzerne mit US-Fokus und eigener Produktion. Ein Comeback fossiler Werte zeichnet sich ab. 3. Technologie & KI: Made in USA statt global Was Trump will: Die digitale Vorherrschaft der USA – unabhängig von europäischen Ethikregeln oder chinesischer Hardware. Das Stargate-Programm in Höhe von 500 Milliarden US-Dollar ist Ausdruck dieser Ambition. Was die Märkte sehen: Oracle als direkter Stargate-Partner profitiert ebenso wie Nvidia, Microsoft oder Palantir. Die Abschaffung regulatorischer Schranken könnte zusätzlich die Innovationsgeschwindigkeit erhöhen – wenn auch mit Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wer in KI investiert, investiert in die neue „digitale Infrastruktur Amerikas“. Trump verleiht dem Sektor nicht nur Budget, sondern auch narrative Schlagkraft. 4. Infrastruktur & Bau: Die Betonwende Was Trump will: Bauen, sichern, modernisieren. Straßen, Zäune, Wohnungen. Bauwirtschaft als Wachstumsanker und Jobmaschine. Was die Märkte sehen: Lennar, D.R. Horton und Caterpillar könnten von staatlichen Großprojekten profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten infolge verschärfter Immigration. Maschinenbauer wie Deere rücken ebenfalls in den Fokus. Anlegerfazit: Infrastrukturunternehmen mit US-Präsenz erhalten direkten Zugang zu Staatsaufträgen – ein klassisches Trump-Muster: Innen vor Außen. 5. Finanzen: Deregulierung Reloaded Was Trump will: Kapitalfreisetzung durch Steuererleichterungen, weniger Bürokratie und neue Anreize für M&A-Aktivitäten. Was die Märkte sehen: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan und Blackstone positionieren sich früh. Der M&A-Boom ist realistisch – ebenso wie steigende Margen im Trading und der Vermögensverwaltung. Anlegerfazit: Banken erleben ein Comeback der Deregulierung. Wer auf Transaktionen, Kreditvergabe und Asset Management setzt, könnte im Finanzsektor neue Erträge erschließen. Strategisches Zwischenfazit für Anleger: Die Politik bestimmt die Börsenordnung neu. Und Anleger, die Trumps Agenda frühzeitig verstehen, können gezielt profitieren. Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Verteidigung Aufrüstung, Sicherheit Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman Energie Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe Exxon, Chevron, Uranium Energy Technologie Stargate, KI-Förderung Oracle, Nvidia, Palanti Infrastruktur Bauprojekte, US-Subventionen Caterpillar, Lennar, D.R. Horton Finanzen Deregulierung, Steuern Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone Der Trump-Turbo für Anleger: Alternative Anlageformen wie ETFs Nicht jeder Privatanleger möchte oder kann gezielt einzelne US-Aktien auswählen, die potenziell von Trumps Politik profitieren. Eine interessante Alternative stellt hier ein Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) dar, der eine breite Streuung und Risikominderung ermöglicht. Durch den Kauf eines US-Aktien-ETFs lässt sich das Kapital auf viele amerikanische Unternehmen verteilen, wodurch man das Potenzial des gesamten US-Marktes nutzen und gleichzeitig das Risiko durch Diversifikation minimieren kann. Ein besonders attraktiver ETF für Börsianer, die am US-Markt partizipieren möchten, ist der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF (ISIN: IE00B3XXRP09). Dieser ETF bildet den S&P 500 Index ab, der die 500 größten US-Unternehmen umfasst. So können Investoren breit gestreut in die US-Wirtschaft investieren, ohne auf einzelne Aktien setzen zu müssen. Der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF hat eine Marktkapitalisierung von ca. 34,6 Milliarden USD (Stand 07.04.2025) und legt seinen Schwerpunkt auf die Branchen Technologie (33,5 Prozent), Finanzwesen (11,0 Prozent), Nicht-Basiskonsumgüter (10,8 Prozent), Gesundheitswesen (10,3 Prozent), in denen sich besonders viele Trump-begünstigte Unternehmen befinden könnten. Beispielsweise sind Schwergewichte wie Apple (7,0 Prozent), Microsoft (6,1 Prozent) und NVIDIA (6,6 Prozent) im ETF enthalten, was Anlegern Zugang zu den größten und profitabelsten Unternehmen der USA verschafft. Der ETF überzeugt zudem durch niedrige Gebühren: Die Gesamtkostenquote (Total Expense Ratio, TER) liegt bei nur 0,07 Prozent pro Jahr. Dividenden werden quartalsweise ausgeschüttet, wie zuletzt im März 2025 (0,30 USD je Anteil), was Anlegern einen zusätzlichen Ertrag ermöglicht. Trotz der attraktiven Möglichkeiten, die ein US-Aktien ETF wie der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF bietet, sollten Anleger jedoch darauf achten, nicht ihr gesamtes Kapital ausschließlich in den US-Markt zu investieren. ETFs auf internationale Märkte können helfen, die Volatilität zu reduzieren und das Risiko weiter zu streuen. Weitere ETFs für Ihren Vermögensaufbau finden Sie hier Beste ETFs.

In mehreren Reden betonte er, dass die militärische Überlegenheit der USA „wieder höchste Priorität“ habe. Lockheed Martin ist bereits heute mit über 70 Prozent seines Umsatzes vom US-Militär abhängig – und dürfte damit direkt von den neuen Großaufträgen profitieren. Im Fokus: Neue F-35-Serien Hyperschall-Raketen (Prompt Strike) Raumfahrtprogramme autonome Überwachungs- und Abwehrsysteme Strategischer Trumpf: Technologischer Vorsprung Trumps Regierung will die Abhängigkeit von ausländischer Verteidigungstechnik reduzieren und verstärkt auf nationale Beschaffung setzen. Als führender Anbieter von High-End-Systemen genießt Lockheed Martin hier eine herausragende Position – technologisch, politisch und organisatorisch. Fundamentale Kennzahlen und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 67,6 Mrd. USD 71,0 Mrd. USD 74,3 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 6,9 Mrd. USD 5,3 Mrd.

Wer auf berechenbare Regierungsaufträge, politische Priorität und technologische Führungsrolle setzen will, findet hier eine Aktie mit hoher Sichtbarkeit und langfristiger Perspektive.

Exxon Mobil Aktie: Neue Chancen durch Trumps Energiepolitik Exxon Mobil Corporation (ISIN: US30231G1022 – Symbol: XOM – Währung: USD) Die Exxon Mobil Corporation, mit Hauptsitz in Irving, Texas, ist eines der weltweit führenden Unternehmen in der Öl- und Gasindustrie. Das Unternehmen deckt die gesamte Wertschöpfungskette ab – von der Exploration über die Produktion bis hin zur Raffination und dem Vertrieb von Erdöl und Erdgas. Die Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „XOM“ gehandelt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 453 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) gehört Exxon Mobil zu den Schwergewichten im Energiesektor und hat eine herausragende Position auf dem globalen Markt. Trumps Energieagenda: Förderung statt Verzicht Donald Trump hat nach seiner Amtseinführung einen nationalen Energienotstand ausgerufen und der Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe höchste Priorität eingeräumt. Genehmigungsverfahren wurden vereinfacht, Umweltstandards gelockert und neue Bohrlizenzen im Offshore-Bereich freigegeben. Für Exxon Mobil bedeutet das konkret: Schnellere und günstigere Produktionsfreigaben Neue Infrastrukturprojekte wie Pipelines und Terminals Steuererleichterungen und Subventionen auf Bundesebene Rückzug aus klimapolitischen Verpflichtungen (Pariser Abkommen) Gleichzeitig erhöht sich der politische Druck auf erneuerbare Energien – was die Marktposition klassischer Öl- und Gasunternehmen zusätzlich stärkt.

USD KGV (2025e) ca. 14 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 3,8 Trotz schwächerer Ölpreise bleibt Exxon profitabel – auch dank effizienter Kostenstruktur, aggressiver Rückkäufe und wachsender Beteiligung an liquefied natural gas (LNG)-Projekten. Analysten sehen im Umfeld steigender globaler Nachfrage und nationaler Förderung weiteres Kurspotenzial. Anlegerfazit: Fossiler Champion mit politischem Schutzschild Exxon Mobil zählt zu den größten Gewinnern der neuen Energiepolitik in den USA. Der politische Rückenwind verstärkt die operative Stärke des Konzerns und macht ihn zu einem potenziellen Dauerläufer – auch in einem volatilen Marktumfeld. Trump-Faktor: Sehr hoch Risiken: Ölpreisabhängigkeit, geopolitische Spannungen Chancen: Genehmigungsschub, steuerliche Vorteile, Infrastruktur-Boom aktienchart von exxon mobil Exxon Mobil Aktienchart 2021 – 2025 / FinMent 3.

USD KGV (2025e) ca. 15 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 2,0 % Caterpillar ist nicht nur profitabel, sondern auch cashflow-stark. Die Nachfrage im US-Markt ist robust, die Book-to-Bill-Ratio in den Bereichen Bau & Mining liegt über 1 – ein Zeichen für solides Wachstum. Zusatztreiber: Deglobalisierung & Rohstoffwende Die protektionistische Handelspolitik der Trump-Regierung wirkt indirekt positiv auf Caterpillar. Denn mit steigenden Zöllen auf Maschinenimporte aus Europa und Asien gewinnen US-Produzenten an Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Gleichzeitig befeuert die globale Unsicherheit Investitionen in Energie- und Rohstoffgewinnung – ein weiteres Standbein für Caterpillar. Anlegerfazit: Realwirtschaftlicher Trump-Profiteur mit Substanz Caterpillar ist kein spekulativer Highflyer, sondern ein solider Konjunkturzykliker mit politischem Rückenwind. Wer auf reale Infrastrukturinvestitionen, Cashflows und US-zentriertes Wachstum setzen will, findet hier eine Trump-Aktie mit Substanz. Trump-Faktor: Hoch Risiken: Zinssensitivität, Projektverzögerungen Chancen: Staatsaufträge, Investitionsdynamik, Subventionsvorteile Caterpillar Aktienchart 2021 – 2025 / FinMent 2. Oracle Aktie: Schlüsselinvestment in Trumps KI-Infrastruktur Oracle Corporation (ISIN: US68389X1054 – Symbol: ORCL – Währung: USD) Die Oracle Corporation mit Hauptsitz in Austin, Texas, ist einer der weltweit führenden Anbieter von Cloud-Computing-Lösungen, Unternehmenssoftware und Datenbankmanagementsystemen. Oracle hat eine starke Position in der Technologiebranche und profitiert von der zunehmenden Digitalisierung und der Nachfrage nach skalierbaren Cloud-Diensten. Die Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „ORCL“ gehandelt.

Oracle ist – neben OpenAI und Softbank – einer der zentralen Technologiepartner. Was das konkret bedeutet: Großaufträge für Rechenzentren und Cloud-Kapazitäten Politische Unterstützung für inländische Datenverarbeitung Wegfall ethischer KI-Regulierung = höhere Innovationsgeschwindigkeit Positionierung als „Sicherheitsanbieter“ im Sinne nationaler Datensouveränität Oracle bringt mit seiner eigenen Cloud-Plattform (OCI – Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) und den weltweit genutzten Datenbanksystemen genau die Fähigkeiten mit, die jetzt politisch gewollt sind: schnell skalierbare Systeme, US-basiert und unter Kontrolle der Regierungspartner.

Regulatorische Auflagen aus der Dodd-Frank-Ära werden gelockert oder gestrichen, Kapitalvorgaben gelockert und steuerliche Anreize für Fusionen und Übernahmen geschaffen. Goldman profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Mehr Spielraum für profitable Eigenhandelsgeschäfte Neue Impulse im M&A-Geschäft – vor allem bei US-Konzernen Wachstum im Asset Management durch steuerbegünstigte Anlagevehikel Repatriierung von Kapital – stärkere US-Fokus-Strategien Die Bank hat bereits signalisiert, ihre M&A-Kapazitäten 2025 auszubauen und erwartet eine Zunahme von IPOs sowie Restrukturierungen in Industrie, Tech und Healthcare.

USD 14,6 Mrd. USD KGV (2025e) ca. 10 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 2,6 % Der Gewinnsprung 2024 wurde durch starke Ergebnisse im Investmentbanking und Handel erzielt.

Anlegerfazit: Profiteur der Freiheit – und der Transaktionen Goldman Sachs zählt zu den wirtschaftspolitischen Hauptprofiteuren der Trump-Administration. Die Mischung aus politischem Rückenwind, strukturellem Wachstumsfeld (M&A, Private Equity) und starker Profitabilität macht die Aktie zu einem strategischen Trump-Investment im Finanzsektor.

BONUS: Trump-Watchlist 2025 – Diese Aktien könnten ebenfalls profitieren Nicht alle Trump-Profiteure haben es in die Top 5 geschafft – doch einige spannende Kandidaten verdienen dennoch einen Platz auf Ihrer Watchlist: Tesla (TSLA) Elon Musk steht Trump politisch überraschend nahe. Sollte Tesla von steuerlichen Erleichterungen, Inlandsproduktion und Infrastrukturprojekten profitieren, könnte die Aktie ungeahnt Rückenwind erhalten – auch ohne direkte Beteiligung am Stargate-Programm. Palantir (PLTR) Das Datenanalyse-Unternehmen mit starken Regierungsbeziehungen könnte im Zuge wachsender Sicherheitsausgaben und nationaler IT-Projekte zusätzliche Aufträge gewinnen – besonders im Bereich KI-gestützter Verteidigung. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Als größter US-Finanzkonzern profitiert JPMorgan breit von Trumps Finanzagenda – von M&A-Fantasie bis zur Kreditvergabe in der Infrastruktur. Lennar & D.R. Horton (LEN, DHI) Die beiden US-Baukonzerne könnten stark von Trumps Wohnungsbauoffensive profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten durch Einwanderungsregulierung. Deere & Company (DE) Als Hersteller von Land- und Baumaschinen ist Deere ein direkter Gewinner nationaler Infrastrukturprojekte – und könnte durch Importzölle auf ausländische Maschinen Marktanteile gewinnen. Hinweis: Diese Aktien sind spekulativer als die Top 5 – bieten aber unter Trumps politischer Agenda gezielte Chancen, vor allem im Bereich Technologie, Bau und nationale Sicherheit.","https://finment.com/boerse-aktien/us-aktien/top-donald-trump-aktien/"

Picture of Adrian Schmid Adrian Schmid | Letzte Aktualisierung am 8.04.2025 Mit seinem Zollhammer erschüttert Donald Trump die globale Wirtschaft – und die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit einem historischen Schockmoment. Seit dem 5. April 2025 gelten in den USA flächendeckende Importzölle von mindestens 10 Prozent, für Produkte aus China sogar 34 Prozent – mit der Drohung, diese um weitere 50 Prozent zu erhöhen. Diese Drohung ist bereits einen Tag später eingetreten – 104 Prozent Zölle gegen China! Die Folge? Ein Blutbad an den Börsen: Der Nasdaq stürzt in nur drei Handelstagen um über 16 Prozent ab Der S&P 500 verliert 15 Prozent Der DAX fällt sogar um 17 Prozent Rohstoffe wie WTI-Öl und Silber rauschen um bis zu 21 Prozent nach unten Der VIX explodiert auf über 60 – Angst dominiert die Wall Street Der Fear & Greed Index steht bei 4: Extreme Fear. Die Aktienmärkte stehen unter Schock – und doch: Mitten im Chaos entstehen neue Chancen. Denn während viele Exporteure, Konsumriesen und Big Tech-Aktien unter Druck geraten, profitieren andere direkt von Trumps Agenda. In diesem Artikel analysieren wir die Top 5 Donald Trump Aktien 2025 – Unternehmen, die vom neuen wirtschaftspolitischen Kurs profitieren könnten: durch nationale Investitionen, steuerliche Entlastungen und gezielte Branchenförderung. Welche Aktien könnten jetzt zur neuen Marktelite aufsteigen – und welche Rolle kann der „Trump-Turbo“ in Ihrem Depot spielen? Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt mit einem crash und börsenbeben, wahl sieg Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt / Shutterstock Donald Trumps Zollhammer 2025: So verändert der US-Präsident den Welthandel Was zunächst wie wirtschaftspolitischer Wahnsinn wirkt, folgt einer klaren Logik: US Präsident Donald Trump will die Vereinigten Staaten zur Festung der Produktion machen. Mit dem pauschalen Importzoll von mindestens 10 Prozent auf alle Waren (seit 5. April 2025) beginnt die Umsetzung seiner protektionistischen Vision einer „autarken Supermacht“. Besonders hart trifft es Länder mit hohen Handelsüberschüssen gegenüber den USA – allen voran China, das mit einer Zollbelastung von insgesamt 54 Prozent konfrontiert ist. Doch auch Deutschland, Japan, Kanada, Vietnam und die Schweiz spüren die neue Zollpolitik deutlich. Der US-Präsident hat klargemacht: Wer amerikanische Produkte blockiert oder unterbietet, zahlt den Preis. Was das bedeutet: Zollankündigung EU-Zölle: 20 Prozent Japan: 25 Prozent auf Autos, 24 Prozent auf Konsumgüter Kanada: 25 Prozent auf nicht in den USA hergestellte Autos Schweiz: 31 Prozent China: 34 Prozent + mögliche Aufstockung auf 50 Prozent Für über 40 Länder gelten Sonderzölle zwischen 30 und 50 Prozent – darunter viele asiatische und afrikanische Staaten. Gleichzeitig läuft eine 51-tägige Übergangsfrist, die bis zum 27. Mai 2025 für Waren gilt, die vor dem Stichtag verschifft wurden. Trumps strategisches Ziel: Handelsbilanz verbessern US-Produktion reindustrialisieren Abhängigkeiten von China & Europa verringern Neue Investitionsanreize im Inland schaffen Ergänzt wird der Zollhammer durch gezielte Ausnahmen für „kritische Rohstoffe und Technologien“ wie Halbleiter, Kupfer oder Arzneimittel – doch selbst diese könnten bald unter Trumps nächste Zollrunde fallen. Zwischenfazit: Trump nutzt den Zoll als geopolitisches und wirtschaftliches Werkzeug – nicht nur zur Machtdemonstration, sondern um gezielt Wachstum zurück in die USA zu zwingen. Für global aufgestellte Unternehmen ist das eine Herausforderung – für national fokussierte US-Konzerne eine historische Chance. DAX, Nasdaq & Co im freien Fall – Was jetzt nach dem Trump-Schock zählt Die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit beispielloser Wucht auf Trumps Zolloffensive – der sogenannte „Trump-Schock 2.0“ entfaltet seine volle Wucht. Innerhalb von nur drei Handelstagen erleben Anleger ein Szenario, das selbst krisenerprobte Marktteilnehmer sprachlos macht: Indizes im freien Fall Nasdaq Composite: –16 Prozent S&P 500: –15 Prozent DAX: –17 Prozent Rohstoffe brechen ein WTI-Öl: –18 Prozent Silber: –21 Prozent Panikindikatoren schlagen Alarm Volatilitätsindex VIX: springt auf über 60 Punkte – der zweithöchste Stand seit dem Corona-Crash Fear & Greed Index: fällt auf 4 von 100 – ein klares Signal für Extreme Fear Was wir erleben, ist nicht nur ein Börsenrücksetzer, sondern ein fundamentaler Stimmungsumschwung. Anleger fliehen aus Risikoassets, verkaufen Tech-Giganten und meiden exportorientierte Geschäftsmodelle. Der globale Kapitalstrom kehrt sich um – weg von Internationalisierung, hin zur nationalen Robustheit. Doch mitten im Tumult beginnt das große Umdenken: Denn während Exporteure taumeln, gewinnen andere an Stärke. US-Unternehmen mit starker Inlandsfokussierung, politischer Rückendeckung und direkter Nähe zu Trumps strategischer Agenda rücken plötzlich ins Zentrum des Anlegerinteresses. trump zoll ankündigung, sturm an den aktienmärken, handelskrieg Trump Zollkrieg / Shutterstock Was jetzt zählt: Wer liefert Stabilität im Inland? Wer profitiert von Staatsaufträgen, Deregulierung und Investitionen? Wer kann unter Trump schneller wachsen – weil die Regeln gelockert sind? Der Markt preist nicht nur Angst ein – er beginnt, neue Gewinner zu suchen. Diese Sektoren sind die neuen Gewinner unter Donald Trump – Aktien mit Potenzial Mit Zöllen, Deregulierung und milliardenschweren Investitionen hat Donald Trump die Spielregeln an der Börse neu definiert. Seine Wirtschaftspolitik belohnt nicht Internationalität, sondern strategischen Patriotismus: Wer in den USA produziert, sich auf das Heimatland fokussiert oder Trumps Agenda bedient, hat plötzlich die Nase vorn. Inmitten der Turbulenzen kristallisieren sich fünf Schlüsselbranchen heraus, die nun politisch priorisiert und finanziell begünstigt werden – und damit zu den neuen Hoffnungsträgern der Märkte avancieren könnten: 1. Verteidigung: Sicherheit wird wieder zur Aktienstory Was Trump will: Einen starken militärischen Industriekomplex. Das Verteidigungsbudget wächst um 80 Milliarden US-Dollar. Der Fokus liegt auf nationaler Unabhängigkeit, technologischem Vorsprung und militärischer Dominanz. Was die Märkte sehen: Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman und General Dynamics stehen am Anfang einer neuen Auftragswelle – von Hyperschallwaffen über Luftverteidigung bis zu autonomen Systemen. Analysten erwarten Milliardenaufträge im zweistelligen Bereich. Anlegerfazit: Planbare Umsätze, politische Priorität, hohe Eintrittsbarrieren. Verteidigung ist unter Trump kein Randthema – sie ist ein Investmenttrend. 2. Energie: Fossil wird wieder strategisch Was Trump will: Volle Energieunabhängigkeit. Öl, Gas, Kohle und Uran sollen Amerikas Grundversorgung sichern – nicht Windräder und Solarpanels aus China. Was die Märkte sehen: Exxon Mobil und Chevron profitieren von beschleunigten Genehmigungen, während Uranium Energy durch die Renaissance der Kernkraft neues Potenzial bekommt. Der Rohstoffmarkt dreht – nicht trotz, sondern wegen geopolitischer Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wachstum durch politische Rückendeckung. Trumps Energiepolitik favorisiert Konzerne mit US-Fokus und eigener Produktion. Ein Comeback fossiler Werte zeichnet sich ab. 3. Technologie & KI: Made in USA statt global Was Trump will: Die digitale Vorherrschaft der USA – unabhängig von europäischen Ethikregeln oder chinesischer Hardware. Das Stargate-Programm in Höhe von 500 Milliarden US-Dollar ist Ausdruck dieser Ambition. Was die Märkte sehen: Oracle als direkter Stargate-Partner profitiert ebenso wie Nvidia, Microsoft oder Palantir. Die Abschaffung regulatorischer Schranken könnte zusätzlich die Innovationsgeschwindigkeit erhöhen – wenn auch mit Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wer in KI investiert, investiert in die neue „digitale Infrastruktur Amerikas“. Trump verleiht dem Sektor nicht nur Budget, sondern auch narrative Schlagkraft. 4. Infrastruktur & Bau: Die Betonwende Was Trump will: Bauen, sichern, modernisieren. Straßen, Zäune, Wohnungen. Bauwirtschaft als Wachstumsanker und Jobmaschine. Was die Märkte sehen: Lennar, D.R. Horton und Caterpillar könnten von staatlichen Großprojekten profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten infolge verschärfter Immigration. Maschinenbauer wie Deere rücken ebenfalls in den Fokus. Anlegerfazit: Infrastrukturunternehmen mit US-Präsenz erhalten direkten Zugang zu Staatsaufträgen – ein klassisches Trump-Muster: Innen vor Außen. 5. Finanzen: Deregulierung Reloaded Was Trump will: Kapitalfreisetzung durch Steuererleichterungen, weniger Bürokratie und neue Anreize für M&A-Aktivitäten. Was die Märkte sehen: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan und Blackstone positionieren sich früh. Der M&A-Boom ist realistisch – ebenso wie steigende Margen im Trading und der Vermögensverwaltung. Anlegerfazit: Banken erleben ein Comeback der Deregulierung. Wer auf Transaktionen, Kreditvergabe und Asset Management setzt, könnte im Finanzsektor neue Erträge erschließen. Strategisches Zwischenfazit für Anleger: Die Politik bestimmt die Börsenordnung neu. Und Anleger, die Trumps Agenda frühzeitig verstehen, können gezielt profitieren. Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Verteidigung Aufrüstung, Sicherheit Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman Energie Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe Exxon, Chevron, Uranium Energy Technologie Stargate, KI-Förderung Oracle, Nvidia, Palanti Infrastruktur Bauprojekte, US-Subventionen Caterpillar, Lennar, D.R. Horton Finanzen Deregulierung, Steuern Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone Der Trump-Turbo für Anleger: Alternative Anlageformen wie ETFs Nicht jeder Privatanleger möchte oder kann gezielt einzelne US-Aktien auswählen, die potenziell von Trumps Politik profitieren. Eine interessante Alternative stellt hier ein Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) dar, der eine breite Streuung und Risikominderung ermöglicht. Durch den Kauf eines US-Aktien-ETFs lässt sich das Kapital auf viele amerikanische Unternehmen verteilen, wodurch man das Potenzial des gesamten US-Marktes nutzen und gleichzeitig das Risiko durch Diversifikation minimieren kann. Ein besonders attraktiver ETF für Börsianer, die am US-Markt partizipieren möchten, ist der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF (ISIN: IE00B3XXRP09). Dieser ETF bildet den S&P 500 Index ab, der die 500 größten US-Unternehmen umfasst. So können Investoren breit gestreut in die US-Wirtschaft investieren, ohne auf einzelne Aktien setzen zu müssen. Der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF hat eine Marktkapitalisierung von ca. 34,6 Milliarden USD (Stand 07.04.2025) und legt seinen Schwerpunkt auf die Branchen Technologie (33,5 Prozent), Finanzwesen (11,0 Prozent), Nicht-Basiskonsumgüter (10,8 Prozent), Gesundheitswesen (10,3 Prozent), in denen sich besonders viele Trump-begünstigte Unternehmen befinden könnten. Beispielsweise sind Schwergewichte wie Apple (7,0 Prozent), Microsoft (6,1 Prozent) und NVIDIA (6,6 Prozent) im ETF enthalten, was Anlegern Zugang zu den größten und profitabelsten Unternehmen der USA verschafft. Der ETF überzeugt zudem durch niedrige Gebühren: Die Gesamtkostenquote (Total Expense Ratio, TER) liegt bei nur 0,07 Prozent pro Jahr. Dividenden werden quartalsweise ausgeschüttet, wie zuletzt im März 2025 (0,30 USD je Anteil), was Anlegern einen zusätzlichen Ertrag ermöglicht. Trotz der attraktiven Möglichkeiten, die ein US-Aktien ETF wie der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF bietet, sollten Anleger jedoch darauf achten, nicht ihr gesamtes Kapital ausschließlich in den US-Markt zu investieren. ETFs auf internationale Märkte können helfen, die Volatilität zu reduzieren und das Risiko weiter zu streuen. Weitere ETFs für Ihren Vermögensaufbau finden Sie hier Beste ETFs.

Die Firma ist bekannt für die Entwicklung und Produktion fortschrittlicher Technologien, darunter Kampfflugzeuge, Raketenabwehrsysteme und Satelliten.

Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 101 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) spielt Lockheed Martin eine zentrale Rolle in der globalen Verteidigungsindustrie. luft und raumfahrt: foto von lockheed martin aktie, flugzeug betankt in der luft ein kampfjet f 35, rüstungs aktien, rolls royce Luftbetankung eines Kampfjets / Lockheed Martin Warum Lockheed Martin unter Trump besonders profitiert Donald Trump hat nach seiner Rückkehr ins Amt die Verteidigungsausgaben massiv erhöht – zusätzlich 80 Milliarden US-Dollar für Modernisierung, Luftverteidigung und Hyperschallwaffen. In mehreren Reden betonte er, dass die militärische Überlegenheit der USA „wieder höchste Priorität“ habe. Lockheed Martin ist bereits heute mit über 70 Prozent seines Umsatzes vom US-Militär abhängig – und dürfte damit direkt von den neuen Großaufträgen profitieren. Im Fokus: Neue F-35-Serien Hyperschall-Raketen (Prompt Strike) Raumfahrtprogramme autonome Überwachungs- und Abwehrsysteme Strategischer Trumpf: Technologischer Vorsprung Trumps Regierung will die Abhängigkeit von ausländischer Verteidigungstechnik reduzieren und verstärkt auf nationale Beschaffung setzen. Als führender Anbieter von High-End-Systemen genießt Lockheed Martin hier eine herausragende Position – technologisch, politisch und organisatorisch. Fundamentale Kennzahlen und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 67,6 Mrd. USD 71,0 Mrd. USD 74,3 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 6,9 Mrd. USD 5,3 Mrd.

Die Cashflows gelten als stabil, das Geschäftsmodell als defensiv robust. Anlegerfazit: Sicherheitsaktie mit politischem Rückenwind Lockheed Martin zählt zu den klaren Profiteuren der Trump-Politik. Wer auf berechenbare Regierungsaufträge, politische Priorität und technologische Führungsrolle setzen will, findet hier eine Aktie mit hoher Sichtbarkeit und langfristiger Perspektive.

Exxon Mobil Aktie: Neue Chancen durch Trumps Energiepolitik Exxon Mobil Corporation (ISIN: US30231G1022 – Symbol: XOM – Währung: USD) Die Exxon Mobil Corporation, mit Hauptsitz in Irving, Texas, ist eines der weltweit führenden Unternehmen in der Öl- und Gasindustrie. Das Unternehmen deckt die gesamte Wertschöpfungskette ab – von der Exploration über die Produktion bis hin zur Raffination und dem Vertrieb von Erdöl und Erdgas. Die Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „XOM“ gehandelt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 453 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) gehört Exxon Mobil zu den Schwergewichten im Energiesektor und hat eine herausragende Position auf dem globalen Markt. Trumps Energieagenda: Förderung statt Verzicht Donald Trump hat nach seiner Amtseinführung einen nationalen Energienotstand ausgerufen und der Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe höchste Priorität eingeräumt. Genehmigungsverfahren wurden vereinfacht, Umweltstandards gelockert und neue Bohrlizenzen im Offshore-Bereich freigegeben. Für Exxon Mobil bedeutet das konkret: Schnellere und günstigere Produktionsfreigaben Neue Infrastrukturprojekte wie Pipelines und Terminals Steuererleichterungen und Subventionen auf Bundesebene Rückzug aus klimapolitischen Verpflichtungen (Pariser Abkommen) Gleichzeitig erhöht sich der politische Druck auf erneuerbare Energien – was die Marktposition klassischer Öl- und Gasunternehmen zusätzlich stärkt.

USD KGV (2025e) ca. 14 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 3,8 Trotz schwächerer Ölpreise bleibt Exxon profitabel – auch dank effizienter Kostenstruktur, aggressiver Rückkäufe und wachsender Beteiligung an liquefied natural gas (LNG)-Projekten. Analysten sehen im Umfeld steigender globaler Nachfrage und nationaler Förderung weiteres Kurspotenzial. Anlegerfazit: Fossiler Champion mit politischem Schutzschild Exxon Mobil zählt zu den größten Gewinnern der neuen Energiepolitik in den USA. Der politische Rückenwind verstärkt die operative Stärke des Konzerns und macht ihn zu einem potenziellen Dauerläufer – auch in einem volatilen Marktumfeld. Trump-Faktor: Sehr hoch Risiken: Ölpreisabhängigkeit, geopolitische Spannungen Chancen: Genehmigungsschub, steuerliche Vorteile, Infrastruktur-Boom aktienchart von exxon mobil Exxon Mobil Aktienchart 2021 – 2025 / FinMent 3. Caterpillar Aktie: Infrastruktur-Maschine für Trumps Bauoffensive Caterpillar Inc. (ISIN: US1491231015 – Symbol: CAT – Währung: USD) Caterpillar ist der weltweit führende Hersteller von Baumaschinen, Diesel- und Gasmotoren, Industrieanlagen sowie Minenequipment. Das Unternehmen mit Sitz in Illinois gilt als konjunktursensitiver Schwergewichtsindex im US-Industriesektor – und ist eine Bau- und Infrastruktur-Aktie par excellence, mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 138 Milliarden US-Dollar (Stand: April 2025). Trumps Infrastrukturpolitik: America Builds Again Donald Trump hat bereits in seiner ersten Amtszeit Infrastrukturprojekte als zentrales Element seiner Wirtschaftspolitik propagiert – doch erst 2025 werden die Pläne massiv umgesetzt. Die neue Regierung kündigte ein 1-Billionen-US-Dollar-Programm zur Modernisierung von Straßen, Brücken, Pipelines und Energieinfrastruktur an. Caterpillar profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Staatliche Nachfrage nach Bau- und Erdbewegungsmaschinen Erleichterte Umweltauflagen für Bauprojekte Stärkung nationaler Lieferketten – Vorteil für US-Produktion Steuervorteile für Investitionen in Maschinen & Ausrüstung Fundamentale Entwicklung und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 67,1 Mrd. USD 71,5 Mrd. USD 75,2 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 9,2 Mrd. USD 10,0 Mrd. USD 10,6 Mrd. USD KGV (2025e) ca. 15 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 2,0 % Caterpillar ist nicht nur profitabel, sondern auch cashflow-stark. Die Nachfrage im US-Markt ist robust, die Book-to-Bill-Ratio in den Bereichen Bau & Mining liegt über 1 – ein Zeichen für solides Wachstum. Zusatztreiber: Deglobalisierung & Rohstoffwende Die protektionistische Handelspolitik der Trump-Regierung wirkt indirekt positiv auf Caterpillar. Denn mit steigenden Zöllen auf Maschinenimporte aus Europa und Asien gewinnen US-Produzenten an Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Gleichzeitig befeuert die globale Unsicherheit Investitionen in Energie- und Rohstoffgewinnung – ein weiteres Standbein für Caterpillar. Anlegerfazit: Realwirtschaftlicher Trump-Profiteur mit Substanz Caterpillar ist kein spekulativer Highflyer, sondern ein solider Konjunkturzykliker mit politischem Rückenwind. Wer auf reale Infrastrukturinvestitionen, Cashflows und US-zentriertes Wachstum setzen will, findet hier eine Trump-Aktie mit Substanz.

Oracle Aktie: Schlüsselinvestment in Trumps KI-Infrastruktur Oracle Corporation (ISIN: US68389X1054 – Symbol: ORCL – Währung: USD) Die Oracle Corporation mit Hauptsitz in Austin, Texas, ist einer der weltweit führenden Anbieter von Cloud-Computing-Lösungen, Unternehmenssoftware und Datenbankmanagementsystemen. Oracle hat eine starke Position in der Technologiebranche und profitiert von der zunehmenden Digitalisierung und der Nachfrage nach skalierbaren Cloud-Diensten. Die Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „ORCL“ gehandelt.

Trump-Effekt: Deregulierung & M&A-Boom Donald Trump verfolgt einen wirtschaftsfreundlichen Kurs mit dem Ziel, die Finanzmärkte zu „entfesseln“. Regulatorische Auflagen aus der Dodd-Frank-Ära werden gelockert oder gestrichen, Kapitalvorgaben gelockert und steuerliche Anreize für Fusionen und Übernahmen geschaffen. Goldman profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Mehr Spielraum für profitable Eigenhandelsgeschäfte Neue Impulse im M&A-Geschäft – vor allem bei US-Konzernen Wachstum im Asset Management durch steuerbegünstigte Anlagevehikel Repatriierung von Kapital – stärkere US-Fokus-Strategien Die Bank hat bereits signalisiert, ihre M&A-Kapazitäten 2025 auszubauen und erwartet eine Zunahme von IPOs sowie Restrukturierungen in Industrie, Tech und Healthcare.

Anlegerfazit: Profiteur der Freiheit – und der Transaktionen Goldman Sachs zählt zu den wirtschaftspolitischen Hauptprofiteuren der Trump-Administration. Die Mischung aus politischem Rückenwind, strukturellem Wachstumsfeld (M&A, Private Equity) und starker Profitabilität macht die Aktie zu einem strategischen Trump-Investment im Finanzsektor.

BONUS: Trump-Watchlist 2025 – Diese Aktien könnten ebenfalls profitieren Nicht alle Trump-Profiteure haben es in die Top 5 geschafft – doch einige spannende Kandidaten verdienen dennoch einen Platz auf Ihrer Watchlist: Tesla (TSLA) Elon Musk steht Trump politisch überraschend nahe. Sollte Tesla von steuerlichen Erleichterungen, Inlandsproduktion und Infrastrukturprojekten profitieren, könnte die Aktie ungeahnt Rückenwind erhalten – auch ohne direkte Beteiligung am Stargate-Programm. Palantir (PLTR) Das Datenanalyse-Unternehmen mit starken Regierungsbeziehungen könnte im Zuge wachsender Sicherheitsausgaben und nationaler IT-Projekte zusätzliche Aufträge gewinnen – besonders im Bereich KI-gestützter Verteidigung. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Als größter US-Finanzkonzern profitiert JPMorgan breit von Trumps Finanzagenda – von M&A-Fantasie bis zur Kreditvergabe in der Infrastruktur. Lennar & D.R. Horton (LEN, DHI) Die beiden US-Baukonzerne könnten stark von Trumps Wohnungsbauoffensive profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten durch Einwanderungsregulierung. Deere & Company (DE) Als Hersteller von Land- und Baumaschinen ist Deere ein direkter Gewinner nationaler Infrastrukturprojekte – und könnte durch Importzölle auf ausländische Maschinen Marktanteile gewinnen. Hinweis: Diese Aktien sind spekulativer als die Top 5 – bieten aber unter Trumps politischer Agenda gezielte Chancen, vor allem im Bereich Technologie, Bau und nationale Sicherheit.","https://finment.com/boerse-aktien/us-aktien/top-donald-trump-aktien/"

Picture of Adrian Schmid Adrian Schmid | Letzte Aktualisierung am 8.04.2025 Mit seinem Zollhammer erschüttert Donald Trump die globale Wirtschaft – und die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit einem historischen Schockmoment. Seit dem 5. April 2025 gelten in den USA flächendeckende Importzölle von mindestens 10 Prozent, für Produkte aus China sogar 34 Prozent – mit der Drohung, diese um weitere 50 Prozent zu erhöhen. Diese Drohung ist bereits einen Tag später eingetreten – 104 Prozent Zölle gegen China! Die Folge? Ein Blutbad an den Börsen: Der Nasdaq stürzt in nur drei Handelstagen um über 16 Prozent ab Der S&P 500 verliert 15 Prozent Der DAX fällt sogar um 17 Prozent Rohstoffe wie WTI-Öl und Silber rauschen um bis zu 21 Prozent nach unten Der VIX explodiert auf über 60 – Angst dominiert die Wall Street Der Fear & Greed Index steht bei 4: Extreme Fear. Die Aktienmärkte stehen unter Schock – und doch: Mitten im Chaos entstehen neue Chancen. Denn während viele Exporteure, Konsumriesen und Big Tech-Aktien unter Druck geraten, profitieren andere direkt von Trumps Agenda. In diesem Artikel analysieren wir die Top 5 Donald Trump Aktien 2025 – Unternehmen, die vom neuen wirtschaftspolitischen Kurs profitieren könnten: durch nationale Investitionen, steuerliche Entlastungen und gezielte Branchenförderung. Welche Aktien könnten jetzt zur neuen Marktelite aufsteigen – und welche Rolle kann der „Trump-Turbo“ in Ihrem Depot spielen? Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt mit einem crash und börsenbeben, wahl sieg Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt / Shutterstock Donald Trumps Zollhammer 2025: So verändert der US-Präsident den Welthandel Was zunächst wie wirtschaftspolitischer Wahnsinn wirkt, folgt einer klaren Logik: US Präsident Donald Trump will die Vereinigten Staaten zur Festung der Produktion machen. Mit dem pauschalen Importzoll von mindestens 10 Prozent auf alle Waren (seit 5. April 2025) beginnt die Umsetzung seiner protektionistischen Vision einer „autarken Supermacht“. Besonders hart trifft es Länder mit hohen Handelsüberschüssen gegenüber den USA – allen voran China, das mit einer Zollbelastung von insgesamt 54 Prozent konfrontiert ist. Doch auch Deutschland, Japan, Kanada, Vietnam und die Schweiz spüren die neue Zollpolitik deutlich. Der US-Präsident hat klargemacht: Wer amerikanische Produkte blockiert oder unterbietet, zahlt den Preis. Was das bedeutet: Zollankündigung EU-Zölle: 20 Prozent Japan: 25 Prozent auf Autos, 24 Prozent auf Konsumgüter Kanada: 25 Prozent auf nicht in den USA hergestellte Autos Schweiz: 31 Prozent China: 34 Prozent + mögliche Aufstockung auf 50 Prozent Für über 40 Länder gelten Sonderzölle zwischen 30 und 50 Prozent – darunter viele asiatische und afrikanische Staaten. Gleichzeitig läuft eine 51-tägige Übergangsfrist, die bis zum 27. Mai 2025 für Waren gilt, die vor dem Stichtag verschifft wurden. Trumps strategisches Ziel: Handelsbilanz verbessern US-Produktion reindustrialisieren Abhängigkeiten von China & Europa verringern Neue Investitionsanreize im Inland schaffen Ergänzt wird der Zollhammer durch gezielte Ausnahmen für „kritische Rohstoffe und Technologien“ wie Halbleiter, Kupfer oder Arzneimittel – doch selbst diese könnten bald unter Trumps nächste Zollrunde fallen. Zwischenfazit: Trump nutzt den Zoll als geopolitisches und wirtschaftliches Werkzeug – nicht nur zur Machtdemonstration, sondern um gezielt Wachstum zurück in die USA zu zwingen. Für global aufgestellte Unternehmen ist das eine Herausforderung – für national fokussierte US-Konzerne eine historische Chance. DAX, Nasdaq & Co im freien Fall – Was jetzt nach dem Trump-Schock zählt Die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit beispielloser Wucht auf Trumps Zolloffensive – der sogenannte „Trump-Schock 2.0“ entfaltet seine volle Wucht. Innerhalb von nur drei Handelstagen erleben Anleger ein Szenario, das selbst krisenerprobte Marktteilnehmer sprachlos macht: Indizes im freien Fall Nasdaq Composite: –16 Prozent S&P 500: –15 Prozent DAX: –17 Prozent Rohstoffe brechen ein WTI-Öl: –18 Prozent Silber: –21 Prozent Panikindikatoren schlagen Alarm Volatilitätsindex VIX: springt auf über 60 Punkte – der zweithöchste Stand seit dem Corona-Crash Fear & Greed Index: fällt auf 4 von 100 – ein klares Signal für Extreme Fear Was wir erleben, ist nicht nur ein Börsenrücksetzer, sondern ein fundamentaler Stimmungsumschwung. Anleger fliehen aus Risikoassets, verkaufen Tech-Giganten und meiden exportorientierte Geschäftsmodelle. Der globale Kapitalstrom kehrt sich um – weg von Internationalisierung, hin zur nationalen Robustheit. Doch mitten im Tumult beginnt das große Umdenken: Denn während Exporteure taumeln, gewinnen andere an Stärke. US-Unternehmen mit starker Inlandsfokussierung, politischer Rückendeckung und direkter Nähe zu Trumps strategischer Agenda rücken plötzlich ins Zentrum des Anlegerinteresses. trump zoll ankündigung, sturm an den aktienmärken, handelskrieg Trump Zollkrieg / Shutterstock Was jetzt zählt: Wer liefert Stabilität im Inland? Wer profitiert von Staatsaufträgen, Deregulierung und Investitionen? Wer kann unter Trump schneller wachsen – weil die Regeln gelockert sind? Der Markt preist nicht nur Angst ein – er beginnt, neue Gewinner zu suchen. Diese Sektoren sind die neuen Gewinner unter Donald Trump – Aktien mit Potenzial Mit Zöllen, Deregulierung und milliardenschweren Investitionen hat Donald Trump die Spielregeln an der Börse neu definiert. Seine Wirtschaftspolitik belohnt nicht Internationalität, sondern strategischen Patriotismus: Wer in den USA produziert, sich auf das Heimatland fokussiert oder Trumps Agenda bedient, hat plötzlich die Nase vorn. Inmitten der Turbulenzen kristallisieren sich fünf Schlüsselbranchen heraus, die nun politisch priorisiert und finanziell begünstigt werden – und damit zu den neuen Hoffnungsträgern der Märkte avancieren könnten: 1. Verteidigung: Sicherheit wird wieder zur Aktienstory Was Trump will: Einen starken militärischen Industriekomplex. Das Verteidigungsbudget wächst um 80 Milliarden US-Dollar. Der Fokus liegt auf nationaler Unabhängigkeit, technologischem Vorsprung und militärischer Dominanz. Was die Märkte sehen: Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman und General Dynamics stehen am Anfang einer neuen Auftragswelle – von Hyperschallwaffen über Luftverteidigung bis zu autonomen Systemen. Analysten erwarten Milliardenaufträge im zweistelligen Bereich. Anlegerfazit: Planbare Umsätze, politische Priorität, hohe Eintrittsbarrieren. Verteidigung ist unter Trump kein Randthema – sie ist ein Investmenttrend. 2. Energie: Fossil wird wieder strategisch Was Trump will: Volle Energieunabhängigkeit. Öl, Gas, Kohle und Uran sollen Amerikas Grundversorgung sichern – nicht Windräder und Solarpanels aus China. Was die Märkte sehen: Exxon Mobil und Chevron profitieren von beschleunigten Genehmigungen, während Uranium Energy durch die Renaissance der Kernkraft neues Potenzial bekommt. Der Rohstoffmarkt dreht – nicht trotz, sondern wegen geopolitischer Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wachstum durch politische Rückendeckung. Trumps Energiepolitik favorisiert Konzerne mit US-Fokus und eigener Produktion. Ein Comeback fossiler Werte zeichnet sich ab. 3. Technologie & KI: Made in USA statt global Was Trump will: Die digitale Vorherrschaft der USA – unabhängig von europäischen Ethikregeln oder chinesischer Hardware. Das Stargate-Programm in Höhe von 500 Milliarden US-Dollar ist Ausdruck dieser Ambition. Was die Märkte sehen: Oracle als direkter Stargate-Partner profitiert ebenso wie Nvidia, Microsoft oder Palantir. Die Abschaffung regulatorischer Schranken könnte zusätzlich die Innovationsgeschwindigkeit erhöhen – wenn auch mit Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wer in KI investiert, investiert in die neue „digitale Infrastruktur Amerikas“. Trump verleiht dem Sektor nicht nur Budget, sondern auch narrative Schlagkraft. 4. Infrastruktur & Bau: Die Betonwende Was Trump will: Bauen, sichern, modernisieren. Straßen, Zäune, Wohnungen. Bauwirtschaft als Wachstumsanker und Jobmaschine. Was die Märkte sehen: Lennar, D.R. Horton und Caterpillar könnten von staatlichen Großprojekten profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten infolge verschärfter Immigration. Maschinenbauer wie Deere rücken ebenfalls in den Fokus. Anlegerfazit: Infrastrukturunternehmen mit US-Präsenz erhalten direkten Zugang zu Staatsaufträgen – ein klassisches Trump-Muster: Innen vor Außen. 5. Finanzen: Deregulierung Reloaded Was Trump will: Kapitalfreisetzung durch Steuererleichterungen, weniger Bürokratie und neue Anreize für M&A-Aktivitäten. Was die Märkte sehen: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan und Blackstone positionieren sich früh. Der M&A-Boom ist realistisch – ebenso wie steigende Margen im Trading und der Vermögensverwaltung. Anlegerfazit: Banken erleben ein Comeback der Deregulierung. Wer auf Transaktionen, Kreditvergabe und Asset Management setzt, könnte im Finanzsektor neue Erträge erschließen. Strategisches Zwischenfazit für Anleger: Die Politik bestimmt die Börsenordnung neu. Und Anleger, die Trumps Agenda frühzeitig verstehen, können gezielt profitieren. Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Verteidigung Aufrüstung, Sicherheit Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman Energie Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe Exxon, Chevron, Uranium Energy Technologie Stargate, KI-Förderung Oracle, Nvidia, Palanti Infrastruktur Bauprojekte, US-Subventionen Caterpillar, Lennar, D.R. Horton Finanzen Deregulierung, Steuern Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone Der Trump-Turbo für Anleger: Alternative Anlageformen wie ETFs Nicht jeder Privatanleger möchte oder kann gezielt einzelne US-Aktien auswählen, die potenziell von Trumps Politik profitieren. Eine interessante Alternative stellt hier ein Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) dar, der eine breite Streuung und Risikominderung ermöglicht. Durch den Kauf eines US-Aktien-ETFs lässt sich das Kapital auf viele amerikanische Unternehmen verteilen, wodurch man das Potenzial des gesamten US-Marktes nutzen und gleichzeitig das Risiko durch Diversifikation minimieren kann. Ein besonders attraktiver ETF für Börsianer, die am US-Markt partizipieren möchten, ist der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF (ISIN: IE00B3XXRP09). Dieser ETF bildet den S&P 500 Index ab, der die 500 größten US-Unternehmen umfasst. So können Investoren breit gestreut in die US-Wirtschaft investieren, ohne auf einzelne Aktien setzen zu müssen. Der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF hat eine Marktkapitalisierung von ca. 34,6 Milliarden USD (Stand 07.04.2025) und legt seinen Schwerpunkt auf die Branchen Technologie (33,5 Prozent), Finanzwesen (11,0 Prozent), Nicht-Basiskonsumgüter (10,8 Prozent), Gesundheitswesen (10,3 Prozent), in denen sich besonders viele Trump-begünstigte Unternehmen befinden könnten. Beispielsweise sind Schwergewichte wie Apple (7,0 Prozent), Microsoft (6,1 Prozent) und NVIDIA (6,6 Prozent) im ETF enthalten, was Anlegern Zugang zu den größten und profitabelsten Unternehmen der USA verschafft. Der ETF überzeugt zudem durch niedrige Gebühren: Die Gesamtkostenquote (Total Expense Ratio, TER) liegt bei nur 0,07 Prozent pro Jahr. Dividenden werden quartalsweise ausgeschüttet, wie zuletzt im März 2025 (0,30 USD je Anteil), was Anlegern einen zusätzlichen Ertrag ermöglicht. Trotz der attraktiven Möglichkeiten, die ein US-Aktien ETF wie der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF bietet, sollten Anleger jedoch darauf achten, nicht ihr gesamtes Kapital ausschließlich in den US-Markt zu investieren. ETFs auf internationale Märkte können helfen, die Volatilität zu reduzieren und das Risiko weiter zu streuen. Weitere ETFs für Ihren Vermögensaufbau finden Sie hier Beste ETFs.

In mehreren Reden betonte er, dass die militärische Überlegenheit der USA „wieder höchste Priorität“ habe. Lockheed Martin ist bereits heute mit über 70 Prozent seines Umsatzes vom US-Militär abhängig – und dürfte damit direkt von den neuen Großaufträgen profitieren. Im Fokus: Neue F-35-Serien Hyperschall-Raketen (Prompt Strike) Raumfahrtprogramme autonome Überwachungs- und Abwehrsysteme Strategischer Trumpf: Technologischer Vorsprung Trumps Regierung will die Abhängigkeit von ausländischer Verteidigungstechnik reduzieren und verstärkt auf nationale Beschaffung setzen. Als führender Anbieter von High-End-Systemen genießt Lockheed Martin hier eine herausragende Position – technologisch, politisch und organisatorisch. Fundamentale Kennzahlen und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 67,6 Mrd. USD 71,0 Mrd. USD 74,3 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 6,9 Mrd. USD 5,3 Mrd.

Die Cashflows gelten als stabil, das Geschäftsmodell als defensiv robust. Anlegerfazit: Sicherheitsaktie mit politischem Rückenwind Lockheed Martin zählt zu den klaren Profiteuren der Trump-Politik. Wer auf berechenbare Regierungsaufträge, politische Priorität und technologische Führungsrolle setzen will, findet hier eine Aktie mit hoher Sichtbarkeit und langfristiger Perspektive.

Exxon Mobil Aktie: Neue Chancen durch Trumps Energiepolitik Exxon Mobil Corporation (ISIN: US30231G1022 – Symbol: XOM – Währung: USD) Die Exxon Mobil Corporation, mit Hauptsitz in Irving, Texas, ist eines der weltweit führenden Unternehmen in der Öl- und Gasindustrie. Das Unternehmen deckt die gesamte Wertschöpfungskette ab – von der Exploration über die Produktion bis hin zur Raffination und dem Vertrieb von Erdöl und Erdgas. Die Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „XOM“ gehandelt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 453 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) gehört Exxon Mobil zu den Schwergewichten im Energiesektor und hat eine herausragende Position auf dem globalen Markt. Trumps Energieagenda: Förderung statt Verzicht Donald Trump hat nach seiner Amtseinführung einen nationalen Energienotstand ausgerufen und der Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe höchste Priorität eingeräumt. Genehmigungsverfahren wurden vereinfacht, Umweltstandards gelockert und neue Bohrlizenzen im Offshore-Bereich freigegeben. Für Exxon Mobil bedeutet das konkret: Schnellere und günstigere Produktionsfreigaben Neue Infrastrukturprojekte wie Pipelines und Terminals Steuererleichterungen und Subventionen auf Bundesebene Rückzug aus klimapolitischen Verpflichtungen (Pariser Abkommen) Gleichzeitig erhöht sich der politische Druck auf erneuerbare Energien – was die Marktposition klassischer Öl- und Gasunternehmen zusätzlich stärkt.

USD KGV (2025e) ca. 14 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 3,8 Trotz schwächerer Ölpreise bleibt Exxon profitabel – auch dank effizienter Kostenstruktur, aggressiver Rückkäufe und wachsender Beteiligung an liquefied natural gas (LNG)-Projekten. Analysten sehen im Umfeld steigender globaler Nachfrage und nationaler Förderung weiteres Kurspotenzial. Anlegerfazit: Fossiler Champion mit politischem Schutzschild Exxon Mobil zählt zu den größten Gewinnern der neuen Energiepolitik in den USA. Der politische Rückenwind verstärkt die operative Stärke des Konzerns und macht ihn zu einem potenziellen Dauerläufer – auch in einem volatilen Marktumfeld. Trump-Faktor: Sehr hoch Risiken: Ölpreisabhängigkeit, geopolitische Spannungen Chancen: Genehmigungsschub, steuerliche Vorteile, Infrastruktur-Boom aktienchart von exxon mobil Exxon Mobil Aktienchart 2021 – 2025 / FinMent 3. Caterpillar Aktie: Infrastruktur-Maschine für Trumps Bauoffensive Caterpillar Inc. (ISIN: US1491231015 – Symbol: CAT – Währung: USD) Caterpillar ist der weltweit führende Hersteller von Baumaschinen, Diesel- und Gasmotoren, Industrieanlagen sowie Minenequipment. Das Unternehmen mit Sitz in Illinois gilt als konjunktursensitiver Schwergewichtsindex im US-Industriesektor – und ist eine Bau- und Infrastruktur-Aktie par excellence, mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 138 Milliarden US-Dollar (Stand: April 2025). Trumps Infrastrukturpolitik: America Builds Again Donald Trump hat bereits in seiner ersten Amtszeit Infrastrukturprojekte als zentrales Element seiner Wirtschaftspolitik propagiert – doch erst 2025 werden die Pläne massiv umgesetzt. Die neue Regierung kündigte ein 1-Billionen-US-Dollar-Programm zur Modernisierung von Straßen, Brücken, Pipelines und Energieinfrastruktur an. Caterpillar profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Staatliche Nachfrage nach Bau- und Erdbewegungsmaschinen Erleichterte Umweltauflagen für Bauprojekte Stärkung nationaler Lieferketten – Vorteil für US-Produktion Steuervorteile für Investitionen in Maschinen & Ausrüstung Fundamentale Entwicklung und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 67,1 Mrd. USD 71,5 Mrd. USD 75,2 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 9,2 Mrd. USD 10,0 Mrd. USD 10,6 Mrd. USD KGV (2025e) ca. 15 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 2,0 % Caterpillar ist nicht nur profitabel, sondern auch cashflow-stark. Die Nachfrage im US-Markt ist robust, die Book-to-Bill-Ratio in den Bereichen Bau & Mining liegt über 1 – ein Zeichen für solides Wachstum. Zusatztreiber: Deglobalisierung & Rohstoffwende Die protektionistische Handelspolitik der Trump-Regierung wirkt indirekt positiv auf Caterpillar. Denn mit steigenden Zöllen auf Maschinenimporte aus Europa und Asien gewinnen US-Produzenten an Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Gleichzeitig befeuert die globale Unsicherheit Investitionen in Energie- und Rohstoffgewinnung – ein weiteres Standbein für Caterpillar. Anlegerfazit: Realwirtschaftlicher Trump-Profiteur mit Substanz Caterpillar ist kein spekulativer Highflyer, sondern ein solider Konjunkturzykliker mit politischem Rückenwind. Wer auf reale Infrastrukturinvestitionen, Cashflows und US-zentriertes Wachstum setzen will, findet hier eine Trump-Aktie mit Substanz.

Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 360 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) spielt Oracle eine zentrale Rolle in der Entwicklung moderner IT-Infrastrukturen.

Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 153 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) spielt Goldman Sachs eine zentrale Rolle im globalen Finanzsektor. Trump-Effekt: Deregulierung & M&A-Boom Donald Trump verfolgt einen wirtschaftsfreundlichen Kurs mit dem Ziel, die Finanzmärkte zu „entfesseln“. Regulatorische Auflagen aus der Dodd-Frank-Ära werden gelockert oder gestrichen, Kapitalvorgaben gelockert und steuerliche Anreize für Fusionen und Übernahmen geschaffen. Goldman profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Mehr Spielraum für profitable Eigenhandelsgeschäfte Neue Impulse im M&A-Geschäft – vor allem bei US-Konzernen Wachstum im Asset Management durch steuerbegünstigte Anlagevehikel Repatriierung von Kapital – stärkere US-Fokus-Strategien Die Bank hat bereits signalisiert, ihre M&A-Kapazitäten 2025 auszubauen und erwartet eine Zunahme von IPOs sowie Restrukturierungen in Industrie, Tech und Healthcare.

USD 14,6 Mrd. USD KGV (2025e) ca. 10 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 2,6 % Der Gewinnsprung 2024 wurde durch starke Ergebnisse im Investmentbanking und Handel erzielt. Für 2025 erwarten Analysten weiteres Wachstum – unterstützt durch die Deregulierung und eine Flut von US-Firmendeals. Anlegerfazit: Profiteur der Freiheit – und der Transaktionen Goldman Sachs zählt zu den wirtschaftspolitischen Hauptprofiteuren der Trump-Administration. Die Mischung aus politischem Rückenwind, strukturellem Wachstumsfeld (M&A, Private Equity) und starker Profitabilität macht die Aktie zu einem strategischen Trump-Investment im Finanzsektor.

BONUS: Trump-Watchlist 2025 – Diese Aktien könnten ebenfalls profitieren Nicht alle Trump-Profiteure haben es in die Top 5 geschafft – doch einige spannende Kandidaten verdienen dennoch einen Platz auf Ihrer Watchlist: Tesla (TSLA) Elon Musk steht Trump politisch überraschend nahe. Sollte Tesla von steuerlichen Erleichterungen, Inlandsproduktion und Infrastrukturprojekten profitieren, könnte die Aktie ungeahnt Rückenwind erhalten – auch ohne direkte Beteiligung am Stargate-Programm. Palantir (PLTR) Das Datenanalyse-Unternehmen mit starken Regierungsbeziehungen könnte im Zuge wachsender Sicherheitsausgaben und nationaler IT-Projekte zusätzliche Aufträge gewinnen – besonders im Bereich KI-gestützter Verteidigung. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Als größter US-Finanzkonzern profitiert JPMorgan breit von Trumps Finanzagenda – von M&A-Fantasie bis zur Kreditvergabe in der Infrastruktur. Lennar & D.R. Horton (LEN, DHI) Die beiden US-Baukonzerne könnten stark von Trumps Wohnungsbauoffensive profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten durch Einwanderungsregulierung. Deere & Company (DE) Als Hersteller von Land- und Baumaschinen ist Deere ein direkter Gewinner nationaler Infrastrukturprojekte – und könnte durch Importzölle auf ausländische Maschinen Marktanteile gewinnen. Hinweis: Diese Aktien sind spekulativer als die Top 5 – bieten aber unter Trumps politischer Agenda gezielte Chancen, vor allem im Bereich Technologie, Bau und nationale Sicherheit.","https://finment.com/boerse-aktien/us-aktien/top-donald-trump-aktien/"

Picture of Adrian Schmid Adrian Schmid | Letzte Aktualisierung am 8.04.2025 Mit seinem Zollhammer erschüttert Donald Trump die globale Wirtschaft – und die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit einem historischen Schockmoment. Seit dem 5. April 2025 gelten in den USA flächendeckende Importzölle von mindestens 10 Prozent, für Produkte aus China sogar 34 Prozent – mit der Drohung, diese um weitere 50 Prozent zu erhöhen. Diese Drohung ist bereits einen Tag später eingetreten – 104 Prozent Zölle gegen China! Die Folge? Ein Blutbad an den Börsen: Der Nasdaq stürzt in nur drei Handelstagen um über 16 Prozent ab Der S&P 500 verliert 15 Prozent Der DAX fällt sogar um 17 Prozent Rohstoffe wie WTI-Öl und Silber rauschen um bis zu 21 Prozent nach unten Der VIX explodiert auf über 60 – Angst dominiert die Wall Street Der Fear & Greed Index steht bei 4: Extreme Fear. Die Aktienmärkte stehen unter Schock – und doch: Mitten im Chaos entstehen neue Chancen. Denn während viele Exporteure, Konsumriesen und Big Tech-Aktien unter Druck geraten, profitieren andere direkt von Trumps Agenda. In diesem Artikel analysieren wir die Top 5 Donald Trump Aktien 2025 – Unternehmen, die vom neuen wirtschaftspolitischen Kurs profitieren könnten: durch nationale Investitionen, steuerliche Entlastungen und gezielte Branchenförderung. Welche Aktien könnten jetzt zur neuen Marktelite aufsteigen – und welche Rolle kann der „Trump-Turbo“ in Ihrem Depot spielen? Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt mit einem crash und börsenbeben, wahl sieg Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt / Shutterstock Donald Trumps Zollhammer 2025: So verändert der US-Präsident den Welthandel Was zunächst wie wirtschaftspolitischer Wahnsinn wirkt, folgt einer klaren Logik: US Präsident Donald Trump will die Vereinigten Staaten zur Festung der Produktion machen. Mit dem pauschalen Importzoll von mindestens 10 Prozent auf alle Waren (seit 5. April 2025) beginnt die Umsetzung seiner protektionistischen Vision einer „autarken Supermacht“. Besonders hart trifft es Länder mit hohen Handelsüberschüssen gegenüber den USA – allen voran China, das mit einer Zollbelastung von insgesamt 54 Prozent konfrontiert ist. Doch auch Deutschland, Japan, Kanada, Vietnam und die Schweiz spüren die neue Zollpolitik deutlich. Der US-Präsident hat klargemacht: Wer amerikanische Produkte blockiert oder unterbietet, zahlt den Preis. Was das bedeutet: Zollankündigung EU-Zölle: 20 Prozent Japan: 25 Prozent auf Autos, 24 Prozent auf Konsumgüter Kanada: 25 Prozent auf nicht in den USA hergestellte Autos Schweiz: 31 Prozent China: 34 Prozent + mögliche Aufstockung auf 50 Prozent Für über 40 Länder gelten Sonderzölle zwischen 30 und 50 Prozent – darunter viele asiatische und afrikanische Staaten. Gleichzeitig läuft eine 51-tägige Übergangsfrist, die bis zum 27. Mai 2025 für Waren gilt, die vor dem Stichtag verschifft wurden. Trumps strategisches Ziel: Handelsbilanz verbessern US-Produktion reindustrialisieren Abhängigkeiten von China & Europa verringern Neue Investitionsanreize im Inland schaffen Ergänzt wird der Zollhammer durch gezielte Ausnahmen für „kritische Rohstoffe und Technologien“ wie Halbleiter, Kupfer oder Arzneimittel – doch selbst diese könnten bald unter Trumps nächste Zollrunde fallen. Zwischenfazit: Trump nutzt den Zoll als geopolitisches und wirtschaftliches Werkzeug – nicht nur zur Machtdemonstration, sondern um gezielt Wachstum zurück in die USA zu zwingen. Für global aufgestellte Unternehmen ist das eine Herausforderung – für national fokussierte US-Konzerne eine historische Chance. DAX, Nasdaq & Co im freien Fall – Was jetzt nach dem Trump-Schock zählt Die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit beispielloser Wucht auf Trumps Zolloffensive – der sogenannte „Trump-Schock 2.0“ entfaltet seine volle Wucht. Innerhalb von nur drei Handelstagen erleben Anleger ein Szenario, das selbst krisenerprobte Marktteilnehmer sprachlos macht: Indizes im freien Fall Nasdaq Composite: –16 Prozent S&P 500: –15 Prozent DAX: –17 Prozent Rohstoffe brechen ein WTI-Öl: –18 Prozent Silber: –21 Prozent Panikindikatoren schlagen Alarm Volatilitätsindex VIX: springt auf über 60 Punkte – der zweithöchste Stand seit dem Corona-Crash Fear & Greed Index: fällt auf 4 von 100 – ein klares Signal für Extreme Fear Was wir erleben, ist nicht nur ein Börsenrücksetzer, sondern ein fundamentaler Stimmungsumschwung. Anleger fliehen aus Risikoassets, verkaufen Tech-Giganten und meiden exportorientierte Geschäftsmodelle. Der globale Kapitalstrom kehrt sich um – weg von Internationalisierung, hin zur nationalen Robustheit. Doch mitten im Tumult beginnt das große Umdenken: Denn während Exporteure taumeln, gewinnen andere an Stärke. US-Unternehmen mit starker Inlandsfokussierung, politischer Rückendeckung und direkter Nähe zu Trumps strategischer Agenda rücken plötzlich ins Zentrum des Anlegerinteresses. trump zoll ankündigung, sturm an den aktienmärken, handelskrieg Trump Zollkrieg / Shutterstock Was jetzt zählt: Wer liefert Stabilität im Inland? Wer profitiert von Staatsaufträgen, Deregulierung und Investitionen? Wer kann unter Trump schneller wachsen – weil die Regeln gelockert sind? Der Markt preist nicht nur Angst ein – er beginnt, neue Gewinner zu suchen. Diese Sektoren sind die neuen Gewinner unter Donald Trump – Aktien mit Potenzial Mit Zöllen, Deregulierung und milliardenschweren Investitionen hat Donald Trump die Spielregeln an der Börse neu definiert. Seine Wirtschaftspolitik belohnt nicht Internationalität, sondern strategischen Patriotismus: Wer in den USA produziert, sich auf das Heimatland fokussiert oder Trumps Agenda bedient, hat plötzlich die Nase vorn. Inmitten der Turbulenzen kristallisieren sich fünf Schlüsselbranchen heraus, die nun politisch priorisiert und finanziell begünstigt werden – und damit zu den neuen Hoffnungsträgern der Märkte avancieren könnten: 1. Verteidigung: Sicherheit wird wieder zur Aktienstory Was Trump will: Einen starken militärischen Industriekomplex. Das Verteidigungsbudget wächst um 80 Milliarden US-Dollar. Der Fokus liegt auf nationaler Unabhängigkeit, technologischem Vorsprung und militärischer Dominanz. Was die Märkte sehen: Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman und General Dynamics stehen am Anfang einer neuen Auftragswelle – von Hyperschallwaffen über Luftverteidigung bis zu autonomen Systemen. Analysten erwarten Milliardenaufträge im zweistelligen Bereich. Anlegerfazit: Planbare Umsätze, politische Priorität, hohe Eintrittsbarrieren. Verteidigung ist unter Trump kein Randthema – sie ist ein Investmenttrend. 2. Energie: Fossil wird wieder strategisch Was Trump will: Volle Energieunabhängigkeit. Öl, Gas, Kohle und Uran sollen Amerikas Grundversorgung sichern – nicht Windräder und Solarpanels aus China. Was die Märkte sehen: Exxon Mobil und Chevron profitieren von beschleunigten Genehmigungen, während Uranium Energy durch die Renaissance der Kernkraft neues Potenzial bekommt. Der Rohstoffmarkt dreht – nicht trotz, sondern wegen geopolitischer Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wachstum durch politische Rückendeckung. Trumps Energiepolitik favorisiert Konzerne mit US-Fokus und eigener Produktion. Ein Comeback fossiler Werte zeichnet sich ab. 3. Technologie & KI: Made in USA statt global Was Trump will: Die digitale Vorherrschaft der USA – unabhängig von europäischen Ethikregeln oder chinesischer Hardware. Das Stargate-Programm in Höhe von 500 Milliarden US-Dollar ist Ausdruck dieser Ambition. Was die Märkte sehen: Oracle als direkter Stargate-Partner profitiert ebenso wie Nvidia, Microsoft oder Palantir. Die Abschaffung regulatorischer Schranken könnte zusätzlich die Innovationsgeschwindigkeit erhöhen – wenn auch mit Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wer in KI investiert, investiert in die neue „digitale Infrastruktur Amerikas“. Trump verleiht dem Sektor nicht nur Budget, sondern auch narrative Schlagkraft. 4. Infrastruktur & Bau: Die Betonwende Was Trump will: Bauen, sichern, modernisieren. Straßen, Zäune, Wohnungen. Bauwirtschaft als Wachstumsanker und Jobmaschine. Was die Märkte sehen: Lennar, D.R. Horton und Caterpillar könnten von staatlichen Großprojekten profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten infolge verschärfter Immigration. Maschinenbauer wie Deere rücken ebenfalls in den Fokus. Anlegerfazit: Infrastrukturunternehmen mit US-Präsenz erhalten direkten Zugang zu Staatsaufträgen – ein klassisches Trump-Muster: Innen vor Außen. 5. Finanzen: Deregulierung Reloaded Was Trump will: Kapitalfreisetzung durch Steuererleichterungen, weniger Bürokratie und neue Anreize für M&A-Aktivitäten. Was die Märkte sehen: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan und Blackstone positionieren sich früh. Der M&A-Boom ist realistisch – ebenso wie steigende Margen im Trading und der Vermögensverwaltung. Anlegerfazit: Banken erleben ein Comeback der Deregulierung. Wer auf Transaktionen, Kreditvergabe und Asset Management setzt, könnte im Finanzsektor neue Erträge erschließen. Strategisches Zwischenfazit für Anleger: Die Politik bestimmt die Börsenordnung neu. Und Anleger, die Trumps Agenda frühzeitig verstehen, können gezielt profitieren. Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Verteidigung Aufrüstung, Sicherheit Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman Energie Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe Exxon, Chevron, Uranium Energy Technologie Stargate, KI-Förderung Oracle, Nvidia, Palanti Infrastruktur Bauprojekte, US-Subventionen Caterpillar, Lennar, D.R. Horton Finanzen Deregulierung, Steuern Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone Der Trump-Turbo für Anleger: Alternative Anlageformen wie ETFs Nicht jeder Privatanleger möchte oder kann gezielt einzelne US-Aktien auswählen, die potenziell von Trumps Politik profitieren. Eine interessante Alternative stellt hier ein Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) dar, der eine breite Streuung und Risikominderung ermöglicht. Durch den Kauf eines US-Aktien-ETFs lässt sich das Kapital auf viele amerikanische Unternehmen verteilen, wodurch man das Potenzial des gesamten US-Marktes nutzen und gleichzeitig das Risiko durch Diversifikation minimieren kann. Ein besonders attraktiver ETF für Börsianer, die am US-Markt partizipieren möchten, ist der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF (ISIN: IE00B3XXRP09). Dieser ETF bildet den S&P 500 Index ab, der die 500 größten US-Unternehmen umfasst. So können Investoren breit gestreut in die US-Wirtschaft investieren, ohne auf einzelne Aktien setzen zu müssen. Der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF hat eine Marktkapitalisierung von ca. 34,6 Milliarden USD (Stand 07.04.2025) und legt seinen Schwerpunkt auf die Branchen Technologie (33,5 Prozent), Finanzwesen (11,0 Prozent), Nicht-Basiskonsumgüter (10,8 Prozent), Gesundheitswesen (10,3 Prozent), in denen sich besonders viele Trump-begünstigte Unternehmen befinden könnten. Beispielsweise sind Schwergewichte wie Apple (7,0 Prozent), Microsoft (6,1 Prozent) und NVIDIA (6,6 Prozent) im ETF enthalten, was Anlegern Zugang zu den größten und profitabelsten Unternehmen der USA verschafft. Der ETF überzeugt zudem durch niedrige Gebühren: Die Gesamtkostenquote (Total Expense Ratio, TER) liegt bei nur 0,07 Prozent pro Jahr. Dividenden werden quartalsweise ausgeschüttet, wie zuletzt im März 2025 (0,30 USD je Anteil), was Anlegern einen zusätzlichen Ertrag ermöglicht. Trotz der attraktiven Möglichkeiten, die ein US-Aktien ETF wie der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF bietet, sollten Anleger jedoch darauf achten, nicht ihr gesamtes Kapital ausschließlich in den US-Markt zu investieren. ETFs auf internationale Märkte können helfen, die Volatilität zu reduzieren und das Risiko weiter zu streuen. Weitere ETFs für Ihren Vermögensaufbau finden Sie hier Beste ETFs.

Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 101 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) spielt Lockheed Martin eine zentrale Rolle in der globalen Verteidigungsindustrie. luft und raumfahrt: foto von lockheed martin aktie, flugzeug betankt in der luft ein kampfjet f 35, rüstungs aktien, rolls royce Luftbetankung eines Kampfjets / Lockheed Martin Warum Lockheed Martin unter Trump besonders profitiert Donald Trump hat nach seiner Rückkehr ins Amt die Verteidigungsausgaben massiv erhöht – zusätzlich 80 Milliarden US-Dollar für Modernisierung, Luftverteidigung und Hyperschallwaffen. In mehreren Reden betonte er, dass die militärische Überlegenheit der USA „wieder höchste Priorität“ habe. Lockheed Martin ist bereits heute mit über 70 Prozent seines Umsatzes vom US-Militär abhängig – und dürfte damit direkt von den neuen Großaufträgen profitieren. Im Fokus: Neue F-35-Serien Hyperschall-Raketen (Prompt Strike) Raumfahrtprogramme autonome Überwachungs- und Abwehrsysteme Strategischer Trumpf: Technologischer Vorsprung Trumps Regierung will die Abhängigkeit von ausländischer Verteidigungstechnik reduzieren und verstärkt auf nationale Beschaffung setzen. Als führender Anbieter von High-End-Systemen genießt Lockheed Martin hier eine herausragende Position – technologisch, politisch und organisatorisch. Fundamentale Kennzahlen und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 67,6 Mrd. USD 71,0 Mrd. USD 74,3 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 6,9 Mrd. USD 5,3 Mrd.

Die Cashflows gelten als stabil, das Geschäftsmodell als defensiv robust. Anlegerfazit: Sicherheitsaktie mit politischem Rückenwind Lockheed Martin zählt zu den klaren Profiteuren der Trump-Politik. Wer auf berechenbare Regierungsaufträge, politische Priorität und technologische Führungsrolle setzen will, findet hier eine Aktie mit hoher Sichtbarkeit und langfristiger Perspektive.

Exxon Mobil Aktie: Neue Chancen durch Trumps Energiepolitik Exxon Mobil Corporation (ISIN: US30231G1022 – Symbol: XOM – Währung: USD) Die Exxon Mobil Corporation, mit Hauptsitz in Irving, Texas, ist eines der weltweit führenden Unternehmen in der Öl- und Gasindustrie. Das Unternehmen deckt die gesamte Wertschöpfungskette ab – von der Exploration über die Produktion bis hin zur Raffination und dem Vertrieb von Erdöl und Erdgas. Die Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „XOM“ gehandelt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 453 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) gehört Exxon Mobil zu den Schwergewichten im Energiesektor und hat eine herausragende Position auf dem globalen Markt. Trumps Energieagenda: Förderung statt Verzicht Donald Trump hat nach seiner Amtseinführung einen nationalen Energienotstand ausgerufen und der Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe höchste Priorität eingeräumt. Genehmigungsverfahren wurden vereinfacht, Umweltstandards gelockert und neue Bohrlizenzen im Offshore-Bereich freigegeben. Für Exxon Mobil bedeutet das konkret: Schnellere und günstigere Produktionsfreigaben Neue Infrastrukturprojekte wie Pipelines und Terminals Steuererleichterungen und Subventionen auf Bundesebene Rückzug aus klimapolitischen Verpflichtungen (Pariser Abkommen) Gleichzeitig erhöht sich der politische Druck auf erneuerbare Energien – was die Marktposition klassischer Öl- und Gasunternehmen zusätzlich stärkt. Fundamentale Entwicklung und Perspektive Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 344 Mrd. USD 349 Mrd. USD 340 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 36,0 Mrd. USD 33,7 Mrd. USD 30,5 Mrd. USD KGV (2025e) ca. 14 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 3,8 Trotz schwächerer Ölpreise bleibt Exxon profitabel – auch dank effizienter Kostenstruktur, aggressiver Rückkäufe und wachsender Beteiligung an liquefied natural gas (LNG)-Projekten. Analysten sehen im Umfeld steigender globaler Nachfrage und nationaler Förderung weiteres Kurspotenzial. Anlegerfazit: Fossiler Champion mit politischem Schutzschild Exxon Mobil zählt zu den größten Gewinnern der neuen Energiepolitik in den USA. Der politische Rückenwind verstärkt die operative Stärke des Konzerns und macht ihn zu einem potenziellen Dauerläufer – auch in einem volatilen Marktumfeld. Trump-Faktor: Sehr hoch Risiken: Ölpreisabhängigkeit, geopolitische Spannungen Chancen: Genehmigungsschub, steuerliche Vorteile, Infrastruktur-Boom aktienchart von exxon mobil Exxon Mobil Aktienchart 2021 – 2025 / FinMent 3. Caterpillar Aktie: Infrastruktur-Maschine für Trumps Bauoffensive Caterpillar Inc. (ISIN: US1491231015 – Symbol: CAT – Währung: USD) Caterpillar ist der weltweit führende Hersteller von Baumaschinen, Diesel- und Gasmotoren, Industrieanlagen sowie Minenequipment. Das Unternehmen mit Sitz in Illinois gilt als konjunktursensitiver Schwergewichtsindex im US-Industriesektor – und ist eine Bau- und Infrastruktur-Aktie par excellence, mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 138 Milliarden US-Dollar (Stand: April 2025). Trumps Infrastrukturpolitik: America Builds Again Donald Trump hat bereits in seiner ersten Amtszeit Infrastrukturprojekte als zentrales Element seiner Wirtschaftspolitik propagiert – doch erst 2025 werden die Pläne massiv umgesetzt. Die neue Regierung kündigte ein 1-Billionen-US-Dollar-Programm zur Modernisierung von Straßen, Brücken, Pipelines und Energieinfrastruktur an. Caterpillar profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Staatliche Nachfrage nach Bau- und Erdbewegungsmaschinen Erleichterte Umweltauflagen für Bauprojekte Stärkung nationaler Lieferketten – Vorteil für US-Produktion Steuervorteile für Investitionen in Maschinen & Ausrüstung Fundamentale Entwicklung und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 67,1 Mrd. USD 71,5 Mrd. USD 75,2 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 9,2 Mrd. USD 10,0 Mrd. USD 10,6 Mrd. USD KGV (2025e) ca. 15 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 2,0 % Caterpillar ist nicht nur profitabel, sondern auch cashflow-stark. Die Nachfrage im US-Markt ist robust, die Book-to-Bill-Ratio in den Bereichen Bau & Mining liegt über 1 – ein Zeichen für solides Wachstum. Zusatztreiber: Deglobalisierung & Rohstoffwende Die protektionistische Handelspolitik der Trump-Regierung wirkt indirekt positiv auf Caterpillar. Denn mit steigenden Zöllen auf Maschinenimporte aus Europa und Asien gewinnen US-Produzenten an Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Gleichzeitig befeuert die globale Unsicherheit Investitionen in Energie- und Rohstoffgewinnung – ein weiteres Standbein für Caterpillar. Anlegerfazit: Realwirtschaftlicher Trump-Profiteur mit Substanz Caterpillar ist kein spekulativer Highflyer, sondern ein solider Konjunkturzykliker mit politischem Rückenwind. Wer auf reale Infrastrukturinvestitionen, Cashflows und US-zentriertes Wachstum setzen will, findet hier eine Trump-Aktie mit Substanz.

Oracle hat eine starke Position in der Technologiebranche und profitiert von der zunehmenden Digitalisierung und der Nachfrage nach skalierbaren Cloud-Diensten. Die Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „ORCL“ gehandelt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 360 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) spielt Oracle eine zentrale Rolle in der Entwicklung moderner IT-Infrastrukturen. Stargate: 500 Milliarden US-Dollar für Amerikas KI-Zukunft Donald Trump hat unmittelbar nach Amtsantritt ein Investitionsprogramm in Höhe von 500 Milliarden US-Dollar angekündigt, das den Ausbau der nationalen KI-Infrastruktur beschleunigen soll.

Regulatorische Auflagen aus der Dodd-Frank-Ära werden gelockert oder gestrichen, Kapitalvorgaben gelockert und steuerliche Anreize für Fusionen und Übernahmen geschaffen. Goldman profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Mehr Spielraum für profitable Eigenhandelsgeschäfte Neue Impulse im M&A-Geschäft – vor allem bei US-Konzernen Wachstum im Asset Management durch steuerbegünstigte Anlagevehikel Repatriierung von Kapital – stärkere US-Fokus-Strategien Die Bank hat bereits signalisiert, ihre M&A-Kapazitäten 2025 auszubauen und erwartet eine Zunahme von IPOs sowie Restrukturierungen in Industrie, Tech und Healthcare.

Anlegerfazit: Profiteur der Freiheit – und der Transaktionen Goldman Sachs zählt zu den wirtschaftspolitischen Hauptprofiteuren der Trump-Administration. Die Mischung aus politischem Rückenwind, strukturellem Wachstumsfeld (M&A, Private Equity) und starker Profitabilität macht die Aktie zu einem strategischen Trump-Investment im Finanzsektor.

BONUS: Trump-Watchlist 2025 – Diese Aktien könnten ebenfalls profitieren Nicht alle Trump-Profiteure haben es in die Top 5 geschafft – doch einige spannende Kandidaten verdienen dennoch einen Platz auf Ihrer Watchlist: Tesla (TSLA) Elon Musk steht Trump politisch überraschend nahe. Sollte Tesla von steuerlichen Erleichterungen, Inlandsproduktion und Infrastrukturprojekten profitieren, könnte die Aktie ungeahnt Rückenwind erhalten – auch ohne direkte Beteiligung am Stargate-Programm. Palantir (PLTR) Das Datenanalyse-Unternehmen mit starken Regierungsbeziehungen könnte im Zuge wachsender Sicherheitsausgaben und nationaler IT-Projekte zusätzliche Aufträge gewinnen – besonders im Bereich KI-gestützter Verteidigung. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Als größter US-Finanzkonzern profitiert JPMorgan breit von Trumps Finanzagenda – von M&A-Fantasie bis zur Kreditvergabe in der Infrastruktur. Lennar & D.R. Horton (LEN, DHI) Die beiden US-Baukonzerne könnten stark von Trumps Wohnungsbauoffensive profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten durch Einwanderungsregulierung. Deere & Company (DE) Als Hersteller von Land- und Baumaschinen ist Deere ein direkter Gewinner nationaler Infrastrukturprojekte – und könnte durch Importzölle auf ausländische Maschinen Marktanteile gewinnen. Hinweis: Diese Aktien sind spekulativer als die Top 5 – bieten aber unter Trumps politischer Agenda gezielte Chancen, vor allem im Bereich Technologie, Bau und nationale Sicherheit.","https://finment.com/boerse-aktien/us-aktien/top-donald-trump-aktien/"

Picture of Adrian Schmid Adrian Schmid | Letzte Aktualisierung am 8.04.2025 Mit seinem Zollhammer erschüttert Donald Trump die globale Wirtschaft – und die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit einem historischen Schockmoment. Seit dem 5. April 2025 gelten in den USA flächendeckende Importzölle von mindestens 10 Prozent, für Produkte aus China sogar 34 Prozent – mit der Drohung, diese um weitere 50 Prozent zu erhöhen. Diese Drohung ist bereits einen Tag später eingetreten – 104 Prozent Zölle gegen China! Die Folge? Ein Blutbad an den Börsen: Der Nasdaq stürzt in nur drei Handelstagen um über 16 Prozent ab Der S&P 500 verliert 15 Prozent Der DAX fällt sogar um 17 Prozent Rohstoffe wie WTI-Öl und Silber rauschen um bis zu 21 Prozent nach unten Der VIX explodiert auf über 60 – Angst dominiert die Wall Street Der Fear & Greed Index steht bei 4: Extreme Fear. Die Aktienmärkte stehen unter Schock – und doch: Mitten im Chaos entstehen neue Chancen. Denn während viele Exporteure, Konsumriesen und Big Tech-Aktien unter Druck geraten, profitieren andere direkt von Trumps Agenda. In diesem Artikel analysieren wir die Top 5 Donald Trump Aktien 2025 – Unternehmen, die vom neuen wirtschaftspolitischen Kurs profitieren könnten: durch nationale Investitionen, steuerliche Entlastungen und gezielte Branchenförderung. Welche Aktien könnten jetzt zur neuen Marktelite aufsteigen – und welche Rolle kann der „Trump-Turbo“ in Ihrem Depot spielen? Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt mit einem crash und börsenbeben, wahl sieg Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt / Shutterstock Donald Trumps Zollhammer 2025: So verändert der US-Präsident den Welthandel Was zunächst wie wirtschaftspolitischer Wahnsinn wirkt, folgt einer klaren Logik: US Präsident Donald Trump will die Vereinigten Staaten zur Festung der Produktion machen. Mit dem pauschalen Importzoll von mindestens 10 Prozent auf alle Waren (seit 5. April 2025) beginnt die Umsetzung seiner protektionistischen Vision einer „autarken Supermacht“. Besonders hart trifft es Länder mit hohen Handelsüberschüssen gegenüber den USA – allen voran China, das mit einer Zollbelastung von insgesamt 54 Prozent konfrontiert ist. Doch auch Deutschland, Japan, Kanada, Vietnam und die Schweiz spüren die neue Zollpolitik deutlich. Der US-Präsident hat klargemacht: Wer amerikanische Produkte blockiert oder unterbietet, zahlt den Preis. Was das bedeutet: Zollankündigung EU-Zölle: 20 Prozent Japan: 25 Prozent auf Autos, 24 Prozent auf Konsumgüter Kanada: 25 Prozent auf nicht in den USA hergestellte Autos Schweiz: 31 Prozent China: 34 Prozent + mögliche Aufstockung auf 50 Prozent Für über 40 Länder gelten Sonderzölle zwischen 30 und 50 Prozent – darunter viele asiatische und afrikanische Staaten. Gleichzeitig läuft eine 51-tägige Übergangsfrist, die bis zum 27. Mai 2025 für Waren gilt, die vor dem Stichtag verschifft wurden. Trumps strategisches Ziel: Handelsbilanz verbessern US-Produktion reindustrialisieren Abhängigkeiten von China & Europa verringern Neue Investitionsanreize im Inland schaffen Ergänzt wird der Zollhammer durch gezielte Ausnahmen für „kritische Rohstoffe und Technologien“ wie Halbleiter, Kupfer oder Arzneimittel – doch selbst diese könnten bald unter Trumps nächste Zollrunde fallen. Zwischenfazit: Trump nutzt den Zoll als geopolitisches und wirtschaftliches Werkzeug – nicht nur zur Machtdemonstration, sondern um gezielt Wachstum zurück in die USA zu zwingen. Für global aufgestellte Unternehmen ist das eine Herausforderung – für national fokussierte US-Konzerne eine historische Chance. DAX, Nasdaq & Co im freien Fall – Was jetzt nach dem Trump-Schock zählt Die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit beispielloser Wucht auf Trumps Zolloffensive – der sogenannte „Trump-Schock 2.0“ entfaltet seine volle Wucht. Innerhalb von nur drei Handelstagen erleben Anleger ein Szenario, das selbst krisenerprobte Marktteilnehmer sprachlos macht: Indizes im freien Fall Nasdaq Composite: –16 Prozent S&P 500: –15 Prozent DAX: –17 Prozent Rohstoffe brechen ein WTI-Öl: –18 Prozent Silber: –21 Prozent Panikindikatoren schlagen Alarm Volatilitätsindex VIX: springt auf über 60 Punkte – der zweithöchste Stand seit dem Corona-Crash Fear & Greed Index: fällt auf 4 von 100 – ein klares Signal für Extreme Fear Was wir erleben, ist nicht nur ein Börsenrücksetzer, sondern ein fundamentaler Stimmungsumschwung. Anleger fliehen aus Risikoassets, verkaufen Tech-Giganten und meiden exportorientierte Geschäftsmodelle. Der globale Kapitalstrom kehrt sich um – weg von Internationalisierung, hin zur nationalen Robustheit. Doch mitten im Tumult beginnt das große Umdenken: Denn während Exporteure taumeln, gewinnen andere an Stärke. US-Unternehmen mit starker Inlandsfokussierung, politischer Rückendeckung und direkter Nähe zu Trumps strategischer Agenda rücken plötzlich ins Zentrum des Anlegerinteresses. trump zoll ankündigung, sturm an den aktienmärken, handelskrieg Trump Zollkrieg / Shutterstock Was jetzt zählt: Wer liefert Stabilität im Inland? Wer profitiert von Staatsaufträgen, Deregulierung und Investitionen? Wer kann unter Trump schneller wachsen – weil die Regeln gelockert sind? Der Markt preist nicht nur Angst ein – er beginnt, neue Gewinner zu suchen. Diese Sektoren sind die neuen Gewinner unter Donald Trump – Aktien mit Potenzial Mit Zöllen, Deregulierung und milliardenschweren Investitionen hat Donald Trump die Spielregeln an der Börse neu definiert. Seine Wirtschaftspolitik belohnt nicht Internationalität, sondern strategischen Patriotismus: Wer in den USA produziert, sich auf das Heimatland fokussiert oder Trumps Agenda bedient, hat plötzlich die Nase vorn. Inmitten der Turbulenzen kristallisieren sich fünf Schlüsselbranchen heraus, die nun politisch priorisiert und finanziell begünstigt werden – und damit zu den neuen Hoffnungsträgern der Märkte avancieren könnten: 1. Verteidigung: Sicherheit wird wieder zur Aktienstory Was Trump will: Einen starken militärischen Industriekomplex. Das Verteidigungsbudget wächst um 80 Milliarden US-Dollar. Der Fokus liegt auf nationaler Unabhängigkeit, technologischem Vorsprung und militärischer Dominanz. Was die Märkte sehen: Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman und General Dynamics stehen am Anfang einer neuen Auftragswelle – von Hyperschallwaffen über Luftverteidigung bis zu autonomen Systemen. Analysten erwarten Milliardenaufträge im zweistelligen Bereich. Anlegerfazit: Planbare Umsätze, politische Priorität, hohe Eintrittsbarrieren. Verteidigung ist unter Trump kein Randthema – sie ist ein Investmenttrend. 2. Energie: Fossil wird wieder strategisch Was Trump will: Volle Energieunabhängigkeit. Öl, Gas, Kohle und Uran sollen Amerikas Grundversorgung sichern – nicht Windräder und Solarpanels aus China. Was die Märkte sehen: Exxon Mobil und Chevron profitieren von beschleunigten Genehmigungen, während Uranium Energy durch die Renaissance der Kernkraft neues Potenzial bekommt. Der Rohstoffmarkt dreht – nicht trotz, sondern wegen geopolitischer Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wachstum durch politische Rückendeckung. Trumps Energiepolitik favorisiert Konzerne mit US-Fokus und eigener Produktion. Ein Comeback fossiler Werte zeichnet sich ab. 3. Technologie & KI: Made in USA statt global Was Trump will: Die digitale Vorherrschaft der USA – unabhängig von europäischen Ethikregeln oder chinesischer Hardware. Das Stargate-Programm in Höhe von 500 Milliarden US-Dollar ist Ausdruck dieser Ambition. Was die Märkte sehen: Oracle als direkter Stargate-Partner profitiert ebenso wie Nvidia, Microsoft oder Palantir. Die Abschaffung regulatorischer Schranken könnte zusätzlich die Innovationsgeschwindigkeit erhöhen – wenn auch mit Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wer in KI investiert, investiert in die neue „digitale Infrastruktur Amerikas“. Trump verleiht dem Sektor nicht nur Budget, sondern auch narrative Schlagkraft. 4. Infrastruktur & Bau: Die Betonwende Was Trump will: Bauen, sichern, modernisieren. Straßen, Zäune, Wohnungen. Bauwirtschaft als Wachstumsanker und Jobmaschine. Was die Märkte sehen: Lennar, D.R. Horton und Caterpillar könnten von staatlichen Großprojekten profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten infolge verschärfter Immigration. Maschinenbauer wie Deere rücken ebenfalls in den Fokus. Anlegerfazit: Infrastrukturunternehmen mit US-Präsenz erhalten direkten Zugang zu Staatsaufträgen – ein klassisches Trump-Muster: Innen vor Außen. 5. Finanzen: Deregulierung Reloaded Was Trump will: Kapitalfreisetzung durch Steuererleichterungen, weniger Bürokratie und neue Anreize für M&A-Aktivitäten. Was die Märkte sehen: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan und Blackstone positionieren sich früh. Der M&A-Boom ist realistisch – ebenso wie steigende Margen im Trading und der Vermögensverwaltung. Anlegerfazit: Banken erleben ein Comeback der Deregulierung. Wer auf Transaktionen, Kreditvergabe und Asset Management setzt, könnte im Finanzsektor neue Erträge erschließen. Strategisches Zwischenfazit für Anleger: Die Politik bestimmt die Börsenordnung neu. Und Anleger, die Trumps Agenda frühzeitig verstehen, können gezielt profitieren. Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Verteidigung Aufrüstung, Sicherheit Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman Energie Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe Exxon, Chevron, Uranium Energy Technologie Stargate, KI-Förderung Oracle, Nvidia, Palanti Infrastruktur Bauprojekte, US-Subventionen Caterpillar, Lennar, D.R. Horton Finanzen Deregulierung, Steuern Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone Der Trump-Turbo für Anleger: Alternative Anlageformen wie ETFs Nicht jeder Privatanleger möchte oder kann gezielt einzelne US-Aktien auswählen, die potenziell von Trumps Politik profitieren. Eine interessante Alternative stellt hier ein Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) dar, der eine breite Streuung und Risikominderung ermöglicht. Durch den Kauf eines US-Aktien-ETFs lässt sich das Kapital auf viele amerikanische Unternehmen verteilen, wodurch man das Potenzial des gesamten US-Marktes nutzen und gleichzeitig das Risiko durch Diversifikation minimieren kann. Ein besonders attraktiver ETF für Börsianer, die am US-Markt partizipieren möchten, ist der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF (ISIN: IE00B3XXRP09). Dieser ETF bildet den S&P 500 Index ab, der die 500 größten US-Unternehmen umfasst. So können Investoren breit gestreut in die US-Wirtschaft investieren, ohne auf einzelne Aktien setzen zu müssen. Der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF hat eine Marktkapitalisierung von ca. 34,6 Milliarden USD (Stand 07.04.2025) und legt seinen Schwerpunkt auf die Branchen Technologie (33,5 Prozent), Finanzwesen (11,0 Prozent), Nicht-Basiskonsumgüter (10,8 Prozent), Gesundheitswesen (10,3 Prozent), in denen sich besonders viele Trump-begünstigte Unternehmen befinden könnten. Beispielsweise sind Schwergewichte wie Apple (7,0 Prozent), Microsoft (6,1 Prozent) und NVIDIA (6,6 Prozent) im ETF enthalten, was Anlegern Zugang zu den größten und profitabelsten Unternehmen der USA verschafft. Der ETF überzeugt zudem durch niedrige Gebühren: Die Gesamtkostenquote (Total Expense Ratio, TER) liegt bei nur 0,07 Prozent pro Jahr. Dividenden werden quartalsweise ausgeschüttet, wie zuletzt im März 2025 (0,30 USD je Anteil), was Anlegern einen zusätzlichen Ertrag ermöglicht. Trotz der attraktiven Möglichkeiten, die ein US-Aktien ETF wie der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF bietet, sollten Anleger jedoch darauf achten, nicht ihr gesamtes Kapital ausschließlich in den US-Markt zu investieren. ETFs auf internationale Märkte können helfen, die Volatilität zu reduzieren und das Risiko weiter zu streuen. Weitere ETFs für Ihren Vermögensaufbau finden Sie hier Beste ETFs.

Die Firma ist bekannt für die Entwicklung und Produktion fortschrittlicher Technologien, darunter Kampfflugzeuge, Raketenabwehrsysteme und Satelliten. Die Lockheed Martin Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „LMT“ gehandelt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 101 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) spielt Lockheed Martin eine zentrale Rolle in der globalen Verteidigungsindustrie. luft und raumfahrt: foto von lockheed martin aktie, flugzeug betankt in der luft ein kampfjet f 35, rüstungs aktien, rolls royce Luftbetankung eines Kampfjets / Lockheed Martin Warum Lockheed Martin unter Trump besonders profitiert Donald Trump hat nach seiner Rückkehr ins Amt die Verteidigungsausgaben massiv erhöht – zusätzlich 80 Milliarden US-Dollar für Modernisierung, Luftverteidigung und Hyperschallwaffen. In mehreren Reden betonte er, dass die militärische Überlegenheit der USA „wieder höchste Priorität“ habe. Lockheed Martin ist bereits heute mit über 70 Prozent seines Umsatzes vom US-Militär abhängig – und dürfte damit direkt von den neuen Großaufträgen profitieren. Im Fokus: Neue F-35-Serien Hyperschall-Raketen (Prompt Strike) Raumfahrtprogramme autonome Überwachungs- und Abwehrsysteme Strategischer Trumpf: Technologischer Vorsprung Trumps Regierung will die Abhängigkeit von ausländischer Verteidigungstechnik reduzieren und verstärkt auf nationale Beschaffung setzen. Als führender Anbieter von High-End-Systemen genießt Lockheed Martin hier eine herausragende Position – technologisch, politisch und organisatorisch. Fundamentale Kennzahlen und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 67,6 Mrd. USD 71,0 Mrd. USD 74,3 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 6,9 Mrd. USD 5,3 Mrd.

USD KGV (2025e) ca. 16 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 3,1 % Analysten sehen weiteres Kurspotenzial, insbesondere wenn Trumps Pläne für Hyperschallwaffen und unbemannte Systeme zügig umgesetzt werden. Die Cashflows gelten als stabil, das Geschäftsmodell als defensiv robust. Anlegerfazit: Sicherheitsaktie mit politischem Rückenwind Lockheed Martin zählt zu den klaren Profiteuren der Trump-Politik. Wer auf berechenbare Regierungsaufträge, politische Priorität und technologische Führungsrolle setzen will, findet hier eine Aktie mit hoher Sichtbarkeit und langfristiger Perspektive. Trump-Faktor: Hoch Risiken: politische Abhängigkeit, internationale Auftragseinbrüche bei Spannungsanstieg Chancen: Milliardenaufträge, technologische Führerschaft, globale Nachfrage nach Sicherheit aktienchart von lockheed martin Lockheed Martin Aktienchart 2021 – 2025 / FinMent 4. Exxon Mobil Aktie: Neue Chancen durch Trumps Energiepolitik Exxon Mobil Corporation (ISIN: US30231G1022 – Symbol: XOM – Währung: USD) Die Exxon Mobil Corporation, mit Hauptsitz in Irving, Texas, ist eines der weltweit führenden Unternehmen in der Öl- und Gasindustrie. Das Unternehmen deckt die gesamte Wertschöpfungskette ab – von der Exploration über die Produktion bis hin zur Raffination und dem Vertrieb von Erdöl und Erdgas. Die Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „XOM“ gehandelt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 453 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) gehört Exxon Mobil zu den Schwergewichten im Energiesektor und hat eine herausragende Position auf dem globalen Markt. Trumps Energieagenda: Förderung statt Verzicht Donald Trump hat nach seiner Amtseinführung einen nationalen Energienotstand ausgerufen und der Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe höchste Priorität eingeräumt. Genehmigungsverfahren wurden vereinfacht, Umweltstandards gelockert und neue Bohrlizenzen im Offshore-Bereich freigegeben. Für Exxon Mobil bedeutet das konkret: Schnellere und günstigere Produktionsfreigaben Neue Infrastrukturprojekte wie Pipelines und Terminals Steuererleichterungen und Subventionen auf Bundesebene Rückzug aus klimapolitischen Verpflichtungen (Pariser Abkommen) Gleichzeitig erhöht sich der politische Druck auf erneuerbare Energien – was die Marktposition klassischer Öl- und Gasunternehmen zusätzlich stärkt. Fundamentale Entwicklung und Perspektive Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 344 Mrd. USD 349 Mrd. USD 340 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 36,0 Mrd. USD 33,7 Mrd. USD 30,5 Mrd. USD KGV (2025e) ca. 14 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 3,8 Trotz schwächerer Ölpreise bleibt Exxon profitabel – auch dank effizienter Kostenstruktur, aggressiver Rückkäufe und wachsender Beteiligung an liquefied natural gas (LNG)-Projekten. Analysten sehen im Umfeld steigender globaler Nachfrage und nationaler Förderung weiteres Kurspotenzial. Anlegerfazit: Fossiler Champion mit politischem Schutzschild Exxon Mobil zählt zu den größten Gewinnern der neuen Energiepolitik in den USA. Der politische Rückenwind verstärkt die operative Stärke des Konzerns und macht ihn zu einem potenziellen Dauerläufer – auch in einem volatilen Marktumfeld. Trump-Faktor: Sehr hoch Risiken: Ölpreisabhängigkeit, geopolitische Spannungen Chancen: Genehmigungsschub, steuerliche Vorteile, Infrastruktur-Boom aktienchart von exxon mobil Exxon Mobil Aktienchart 2021 – 2025 / FinMent 3. Caterpillar Aktie: Infrastruktur-Maschine für Trumps Bauoffensive Caterpillar Inc. (ISIN: US1491231015 – Symbol: CAT – Währung: USD) Caterpillar ist der weltweit führende Hersteller von Baumaschinen, Diesel- und Gasmotoren, Industrieanlagen sowie Minenequipment. Das Unternehmen mit Sitz in Illinois gilt als konjunktursensitiver Schwergewichtsindex im US-Industriesektor – und ist eine Bau- und Infrastruktur-Aktie par excellence, mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 138 Milliarden US-Dollar (Stand: April 2025). Trumps Infrastrukturpolitik: America Builds Again Donald Trump hat bereits in seiner ersten Amtszeit Infrastrukturprojekte als zentrales Element seiner Wirtschaftspolitik propagiert – doch erst 2025 werden die Pläne massiv umgesetzt. Die neue Regierung kündigte ein 1-Billionen-US-Dollar-Programm zur Modernisierung von Straßen, Brücken, Pipelines und Energieinfrastruktur an. Caterpillar profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Staatliche Nachfrage nach Bau- und Erdbewegungsmaschinen Erleichterte Umweltauflagen für Bauprojekte Stärkung nationaler Lieferketten – Vorteil für US-Produktion Steuervorteile für Investitionen in Maschinen & Ausrüstung Fundamentale Entwicklung und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 67,1 Mrd. USD 71,5 Mrd. USD 75,2 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 9,2 Mrd. USD 10,0 Mrd. USD 10,6 Mrd. USD KGV (2025e) ca. 15 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 2,0 % Caterpillar ist nicht nur profitabel, sondern auch cashflow-stark. Die Nachfrage im US-Markt ist robust, die Book-to-Bill-Ratio in den Bereichen Bau & Mining liegt über 1 – ein Zeichen für solides Wachstum. Zusatztreiber: Deglobalisierung & Rohstoffwende Die protektionistische Handelspolitik der Trump-Regierung wirkt indirekt positiv auf Caterpillar. Denn mit steigenden Zöllen auf Maschinenimporte aus Europa und Asien gewinnen US-Produzenten an Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Gleichzeitig befeuert die globale Unsicherheit Investitionen in Energie- und Rohstoffgewinnung – ein weiteres Standbein für Caterpillar. Anlegerfazit: Realwirtschaftlicher Trump-Profiteur mit Substanz Caterpillar ist kein spekulativer Highflyer, sondern ein solider Konjunkturzykliker mit politischem Rückenwind. Wer auf reale Infrastrukturinvestitionen, Cashflows und US-zentriertes Wachstum setzen will, findet hier eine Trump-Aktie mit Substanz.

Oracle hat eine starke Position in der Technologiebranche und profitiert von der zunehmenden Digitalisierung und der Nachfrage nach skalierbaren Cloud-Diensten. Die Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „ORCL“ gehandelt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 360 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) spielt Oracle eine zentrale Rolle in der Entwicklung moderner IT-Infrastrukturen. Stargate: 500 Milliarden US-Dollar für Amerikas KI-Zukunft Donald Trump hat unmittelbar nach Amtsantritt ein Investitionsprogramm in Höhe von 500 Milliarden US-Dollar angekündigt, das den Ausbau der nationalen KI-Infrastruktur beschleunigen soll. Oracle ist – neben OpenAI und Softbank – einer der zentralen Technologiepartner. Was das konkret bedeutet: Großaufträge für Rechenzentren und Cloud-Kapazitäten Politische Unterstützung für inländische Datenverarbeitung Wegfall ethischer KI-Regulierung = höhere Innovationsgeschwindigkeit Positionierung als „Sicherheitsanbieter“ im Sinne nationaler Datensouveränität Oracle bringt mit seiner eigenen Cloud-Plattform (OCI – Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) und den weltweit genutzten Datenbanksystemen genau die Fähigkeiten mit, die jetzt politisch gewollt sind: schnell skalierbare Systeme, US-basiert und unter Kontrolle der Regierungspartner. Fundamentale Entwicklung und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 50,0 Mrd. USD 53,0 Mrd. USD 57,0 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 8,5 Mrd. USD 10,5 Mrd. USD 12,5 Mrd.

Regulatorische Auflagen aus der Dodd-Frank-Ära werden gelockert oder gestrichen, Kapitalvorgaben gelockert und steuerliche Anreize für Fusionen und Übernahmen geschaffen. Goldman profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Mehr Spielraum für profitable Eigenhandelsgeschäfte Neue Impulse im M&A-Geschäft – vor allem bei US-Konzernen Wachstum im Asset Management durch steuerbegünstigte Anlagevehikel Repatriierung von Kapital – stärkere US-Fokus-Strategien Die Bank hat bereits signalisiert, ihre M&A-Kapazitäten 2025 auszubauen und erwartet eine Zunahme von IPOs sowie Restrukturierungen in Industrie, Tech und Healthcare.

BONUS: Trump-Watchlist 2025 – Diese Aktien könnten ebenfalls profitieren Nicht alle Trump-Profiteure haben es in die Top 5 geschafft – doch einige spannende Kandidaten verdienen dennoch einen Platz auf Ihrer Watchlist: Tesla (TSLA) Elon Musk steht Trump politisch überraschend nahe. Sollte Tesla von steuerlichen Erleichterungen, Inlandsproduktion und Infrastrukturprojekten profitieren, könnte die Aktie ungeahnt Rückenwind erhalten – auch ohne direkte Beteiligung am Stargate-Programm. Palantir (PLTR) Das Datenanalyse-Unternehmen mit starken Regierungsbeziehungen könnte im Zuge wachsender Sicherheitsausgaben und nationaler IT-Projekte zusätzliche Aufträge gewinnen – besonders im Bereich KI-gestützter Verteidigung. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Als größter US-Finanzkonzern profitiert JPMorgan breit von Trumps Finanzagenda – von M&A-Fantasie bis zur Kreditvergabe in der Infrastruktur. Lennar & D.R. Horton (LEN, DHI) Die beiden US-Baukonzerne könnten stark von Trumps Wohnungsbauoffensive profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten durch Einwanderungsregulierung. Deere & Company (DE) Als Hersteller von Land- und Baumaschinen ist Deere ein direkter Gewinner nationaler Infrastrukturprojekte – und könnte durch Importzölle auf ausländische Maschinen Marktanteile gewinnen. Hinweis: Diese Aktien sind spekulativer als die Top 5 – bieten aber unter Trumps politischer Agenda gezielte Chancen, vor allem im Bereich Technologie, Bau und nationale Sicherheit.","https://finment.com/boerse-aktien/us-aktien/top-donald-trump-aktien/"

Picture of Adrian Schmid Adrian Schmid | Letzte Aktualisierung am 8.04.2025 Mit seinem Zollhammer erschüttert Donald Trump die globale Wirtschaft – und die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit einem historischen Schockmoment. Seit dem 5. April 2025 gelten in den USA flächendeckende Importzölle von mindestens 10 Prozent, für Produkte aus China sogar 34 Prozent – mit der Drohung, diese um weitere 50 Prozent zu erhöhen. Diese Drohung ist bereits einen Tag später eingetreten – 104 Prozent Zölle gegen China! Die Folge? Ein Blutbad an den Börsen: Der Nasdaq stürzt in nur drei Handelstagen um über 16 Prozent ab Der S&P 500 verliert 15 Prozent Der DAX fällt sogar um 17 Prozent Rohstoffe wie WTI-Öl und Silber rauschen um bis zu 21 Prozent nach unten Der VIX explodiert auf über 60 – Angst dominiert die Wall Street Der Fear & Greed Index steht bei 4: Extreme Fear. Die Aktienmärkte stehen unter Schock – und doch: Mitten im Chaos entstehen neue Chancen. Denn während viele Exporteure, Konsumriesen und Big Tech-Aktien unter Druck geraten, profitieren andere direkt von Trumps Agenda. In diesem Artikel analysieren wir die Top 5 Donald Trump Aktien 2025 – Unternehmen, die vom neuen wirtschaftspolitischen Kurs profitieren könnten: durch nationale Investitionen, steuerliche Entlastungen und gezielte Branchenförderung. Welche Aktien könnten jetzt zur neuen Marktelite aufsteigen – und welche Rolle kann der „Trump-Turbo“ in Ihrem Depot spielen? Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt mit einem crash und börsenbeben, wahl sieg Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt / Shutterstock Donald Trumps Zollhammer 2025: So verändert der US-Präsident den Welthandel Was zunächst wie wirtschaftspolitischer Wahnsinn wirkt, folgt einer klaren Logik: US Präsident Donald Trump will die Vereinigten Staaten zur Festung der Produktion machen. Mit dem pauschalen Importzoll von mindestens 10 Prozent auf alle Waren (seit 5. April 2025) beginnt die Umsetzung seiner protektionistischen Vision einer „autarken Supermacht“. Besonders hart trifft es Länder mit hohen Handelsüberschüssen gegenüber den USA – allen voran China, das mit einer Zollbelastung von insgesamt 54 Prozent konfrontiert ist. Doch auch Deutschland, Japan, Kanada, Vietnam und die Schweiz spüren die neue Zollpolitik deutlich. Der US-Präsident hat klargemacht: Wer amerikanische Produkte blockiert oder unterbietet, zahlt den Preis. Was das bedeutet: Zollankündigung EU-Zölle: 20 Prozent Japan: 25 Prozent auf Autos, 24 Prozent auf Konsumgüter Kanada: 25 Prozent auf nicht in den USA hergestellte Autos Schweiz: 31 Prozent China: 34 Prozent + mögliche Aufstockung auf 50 Prozent Für über 40 Länder gelten Sonderzölle zwischen 30 und 50 Prozent – darunter viele asiatische und afrikanische Staaten. Gleichzeitig läuft eine 51-tägige Übergangsfrist, die bis zum 27. Mai 2025 für Waren gilt, die vor dem Stichtag verschifft wurden. Trumps strategisches Ziel: Handelsbilanz verbessern US-Produktion reindustrialisieren Abhängigkeiten von China & Europa verringern Neue Investitionsanreize im Inland schaffen Ergänzt wird der Zollhammer durch gezielte Ausnahmen für „kritische Rohstoffe und Technologien“ wie Halbleiter, Kupfer oder Arzneimittel – doch selbst diese könnten bald unter Trumps nächste Zollrunde fallen. Zwischenfazit: Trump nutzt den Zoll als geopolitisches und wirtschaftliches Werkzeug – nicht nur zur Machtdemonstration, sondern um gezielt Wachstum zurück in die USA zu zwingen. Für global aufgestellte Unternehmen ist das eine Herausforderung – für national fokussierte US-Konzerne eine historische Chance. DAX, Nasdaq & Co im freien Fall – Was jetzt nach dem Trump-Schock zählt Die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit beispielloser Wucht auf Trumps Zolloffensive – der sogenannte „Trump-Schock 2.0“ entfaltet seine volle Wucht. Innerhalb von nur drei Handelstagen erleben Anleger ein Szenario, das selbst krisenerprobte Marktteilnehmer sprachlos macht: Indizes im freien Fall Nasdaq Composite: –16 Prozent S&P 500: –15 Prozent DAX: –17 Prozent Rohstoffe brechen ein WTI-Öl: –18 Prozent Silber: –21 Prozent Panikindikatoren schlagen Alarm Volatilitätsindex VIX: springt auf über 60 Punkte – der zweithöchste Stand seit dem Corona-Crash Fear & Greed Index: fällt auf 4 von 100 – ein klares Signal für Extreme Fear Was wir erleben, ist nicht nur ein Börsenrücksetzer, sondern ein fundamentaler Stimmungsumschwung. Anleger fliehen aus Risikoassets, verkaufen Tech-Giganten und meiden exportorientierte Geschäftsmodelle. Der globale Kapitalstrom kehrt sich um – weg von Internationalisierung, hin zur nationalen Robustheit. Doch mitten im Tumult beginnt das große Umdenken: Denn während Exporteure taumeln, gewinnen andere an Stärke. US-Unternehmen mit starker Inlandsfokussierung, politischer Rückendeckung und direkter Nähe zu Trumps strategischer Agenda rücken plötzlich ins Zentrum des Anlegerinteresses. trump zoll ankündigung, sturm an den aktienmärken, handelskrieg Trump Zollkrieg / Shutterstock Was jetzt zählt: Wer liefert Stabilität im Inland? Wer profitiert von Staatsaufträgen, Deregulierung und Investitionen? Wer kann unter Trump schneller wachsen – weil die Regeln gelockert sind? Der Markt preist nicht nur Angst ein – er beginnt, neue Gewinner zu suchen. Diese Sektoren sind die neuen Gewinner unter Donald Trump – Aktien mit Potenzial Mit Zöllen, Deregulierung und milliardenschweren Investitionen hat Donald Trump die Spielregeln an der Börse neu definiert. Seine Wirtschaftspolitik belohnt nicht Internationalität, sondern strategischen Patriotismus: Wer in den USA produziert, sich auf das Heimatland fokussiert oder Trumps Agenda bedient, hat plötzlich die Nase vorn. Inmitten der Turbulenzen kristallisieren sich fünf Schlüsselbranchen heraus, die nun politisch priorisiert und finanziell begünstigt werden – und damit zu den neuen Hoffnungsträgern der Märkte avancieren könnten: 1. Verteidigung: Sicherheit wird wieder zur Aktienstory Was Trump will: Einen starken militärischen Industriekomplex. Das Verteidigungsbudget wächst um 80 Milliarden US-Dollar. Der Fokus liegt auf nationaler Unabhängigkeit, technologischem Vorsprung und militärischer Dominanz. Was die Märkte sehen: Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman und General Dynamics stehen am Anfang einer neuen Auftragswelle – von Hyperschallwaffen über Luftverteidigung bis zu autonomen Systemen. Analysten erwarten Milliardenaufträge im zweistelligen Bereich. Anlegerfazit: Planbare Umsätze, politische Priorität, hohe Eintrittsbarrieren. Verteidigung ist unter Trump kein Randthema – sie ist ein Investmenttrend. 2. Energie: Fossil wird wieder strategisch Was Trump will: Volle Energieunabhängigkeit. Öl, Gas, Kohle und Uran sollen Amerikas Grundversorgung sichern – nicht Windräder und Solarpanels aus China. Was die Märkte sehen: Exxon Mobil und Chevron profitieren von beschleunigten Genehmigungen, während Uranium Energy durch die Renaissance der Kernkraft neues Potenzial bekommt. Der Rohstoffmarkt dreht – nicht trotz, sondern wegen geopolitischer Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wachstum durch politische Rückendeckung. Trumps Energiepolitik favorisiert Konzerne mit US-Fokus und eigener Produktion. Ein Comeback fossiler Werte zeichnet sich ab. 3. Technologie & KI: Made in USA statt global Was Trump will: Die digitale Vorherrschaft der USA – unabhängig von europäischen Ethikregeln oder chinesischer Hardware. Das Stargate-Programm in Höhe von 500 Milliarden US-Dollar ist Ausdruck dieser Ambition. Was die Märkte sehen: Oracle als direkter Stargate-Partner profitiert ebenso wie Nvidia, Microsoft oder Palantir. Die Abschaffung regulatorischer Schranken könnte zusätzlich die Innovationsgeschwindigkeit erhöhen – wenn auch mit Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wer in KI investiert, investiert in die neue „digitale Infrastruktur Amerikas“. Trump verleiht dem Sektor nicht nur Budget, sondern auch narrative Schlagkraft. 4. Infrastruktur & Bau: Die Betonwende Was Trump will: Bauen, sichern, modernisieren. Straßen, Zäune, Wohnungen. Bauwirtschaft als Wachstumsanker und Jobmaschine. Was die Märkte sehen: Lennar, D.R. Horton und Caterpillar könnten von staatlichen Großprojekten profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten infolge verschärfter Immigration. Maschinenbauer wie Deere rücken ebenfalls in den Fokus. Anlegerfazit: Infrastrukturunternehmen mit US-Präsenz erhalten direkten Zugang zu Staatsaufträgen – ein klassisches Trump-Muster: Innen vor Außen. 5. Finanzen: Deregulierung Reloaded Was Trump will: Kapitalfreisetzung durch Steuererleichterungen, weniger Bürokratie und neue Anreize für M&A-Aktivitäten. Was die Märkte sehen: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan und Blackstone positionieren sich früh. Der M&A-Boom ist realistisch – ebenso wie steigende Margen im Trading und der Vermögensverwaltung. Anlegerfazit: Banken erleben ein Comeback der Deregulierung. Wer auf Transaktionen, Kreditvergabe und Asset Management setzt, könnte im Finanzsektor neue Erträge erschließen. Strategisches Zwischenfazit für Anleger: Die Politik bestimmt die Börsenordnung neu. Und Anleger, die Trumps Agenda frühzeitig verstehen, können gezielt profitieren. Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Verteidigung Aufrüstung, Sicherheit Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman Energie Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe Exxon, Chevron, Uranium Energy Technologie Stargate, KI-Förderung Oracle, Nvidia, Palanti Infrastruktur Bauprojekte, US-Subventionen Caterpillar, Lennar, D.R. Horton Finanzen Deregulierung, Steuern Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone Der Trump-Turbo für Anleger: Alternative Anlageformen wie ETFs Nicht jeder Privatanleger möchte oder kann gezielt einzelne US-Aktien auswählen, die potenziell von Trumps Politik profitieren. Eine interessante Alternative stellt hier ein Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) dar, der eine breite Streuung und Risikominderung ermöglicht. Durch den Kauf eines US-Aktien-ETFs lässt sich das Kapital auf viele amerikanische Unternehmen verteilen, wodurch man das Potenzial des gesamten US-Marktes nutzen und gleichzeitig das Risiko durch Diversifikation minimieren kann. Ein besonders attraktiver ETF für Börsianer, die am US-Markt partizipieren möchten, ist der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF (ISIN: IE00B3XXRP09). Dieser ETF bildet den S&P 500 Index ab, der die 500 größten US-Unternehmen umfasst. So können Investoren breit gestreut in die US-Wirtschaft investieren, ohne auf einzelne Aktien setzen zu müssen. Der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF hat eine Marktkapitalisierung von ca. 34,6 Milliarden USD (Stand 07.04.2025) und legt seinen Schwerpunkt auf die Branchen Technologie (33,5 Prozent), Finanzwesen (11,0 Prozent), Nicht-Basiskonsumgüter (10,8 Prozent), Gesundheitswesen (10,3 Prozent), in denen sich besonders viele Trump-begünstigte Unternehmen befinden könnten. Beispielsweise sind Schwergewichte wie Apple (7,0 Prozent), Microsoft (6,1 Prozent) und NVIDIA (6,6 Prozent) im ETF enthalten, was Anlegern Zugang zu den größten und profitabelsten Unternehmen der USA verschafft. Der ETF überzeugt zudem durch niedrige Gebühren: Die Gesamtkostenquote (Total Expense Ratio, TER) liegt bei nur 0,07 Prozent pro Jahr. Dividenden werden quartalsweise ausgeschüttet, wie zuletzt im März 2025 (0,30 USD je Anteil), was Anlegern einen zusätzlichen Ertrag ermöglicht. Trotz der attraktiven Möglichkeiten, die ein US-Aktien ETF wie der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF bietet, sollten Anleger jedoch darauf achten, nicht ihr gesamtes Kapital ausschließlich in den US-Markt zu investieren. ETFs auf internationale Märkte können helfen, die Volatilität zu reduzieren und das Risiko weiter zu streuen. Weitere ETFs für Ihren Vermögensaufbau finden Sie hier Beste ETFs.

Die Firma ist bekannt für die Entwicklung und Produktion fortschrittlicher Technologien, darunter Kampfflugzeuge, Raketenabwehrsysteme und Satelliten. Die Lockheed Martin Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „LMT“ gehandelt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 101 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) spielt Lockheed Martin eine zentrale Rolle in der globalen Verteidigungsindustrie. luft und raumfahrt: foto von lockheed martin aktie, flugzeug betankt in der luft ein kampfjet f 35, rüstungs aktien, rolls royce Luftbetankung eines Kampfjets / Lockheed Martin Warum Lockheed Martin unter Trump besonders profitiert Donald Trump hat nach seiner Rückkehr ins Amt die Verteidigungsausgaben massiv erhöht – zusätzlich 80 Milliarden US-Dollar für Modernisierung, Luftverteidigung und Hyperschallwaffen. In mehreren Reden betonte er, dass die militärische Überlegenheit der USA „wieder höchste Priorität“ habe. Lockheed Martin ist bereits heute mit über 70 Prozent seines Umsatzes vom US-Militär abhängig – und dürfte damit direkt von den neuen Großaufträgen profitieren. Im Fokus: Neue F-35-Serien Hyperschall-Raketen (Prompt Strike) Raumfahrtprogramme autonome Überwachungs- und Abwehrsysteme Strategischer Trumpf: Technologischer Vorsprung Trumps Regierung will die Abhängigkeit von ausländischer Verteidigungstechnik reduzieren und verstärkt auf nationale Beschaffung setzen. Als führender Anbieter von High-End-Systemen genießt Lockheed Martin hier eine herausragende Position – technologisch, politisch und organisatorisch. Fundamentale Kennzahlen und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 67,6 Mrd. USD 71,0 Mrd. USD 74,3 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 6,9 Mrd. USD 5,3 Mrd.

Die Cashflows gelten als stabil, das Geschäftsmodell als defensiv robust. Anlegerfazit: Sicherheitsaktie mit politischem Rückenwind Lockheed Martin zählt zu den klaren Profiteuren der Trump-Politik. Wer auf berechenbare Regierungsaufträge, politische Priorität und technologische Führungsrolle setzen will, findet hier eine Aktie mit hoher Sichtbarkeit und langfristiger Perspektive.

Exxon Mobil Aktie: Neue Chancen durch Trumps Energiepolitik Exxon Mobil Corporation (ISIN: US30231G1022 – Symbol: XOM – Währung: USD) Die Exxon Mobil Corporation, mit Hauptsitz in Irving, Texas, ist eines der weltweit führenden Unternehmen in der Öl- und Gasindustrie. Das Unternehmen deckt die gesamte Wertschöpfungskette ab – von der Exploration über die Produktion bis hin zur Raffination und dem Vertrieb von Erdöl und Erdgas. Die Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „XOM“ gehandelt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 453 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) gehört Exxon Mobil zu den Schwergewichten im Energiesektor und hat eine herausragende Position auf dem globalen Markt. Trumps Energieagenda: Förderung statt Verzicht Donald Trump hat nach seiner Amtseinführung einen nationalen Energienotstand ausgerufen und der Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe höchste Priorität eingeräumt. Genehmigungsverfahren wurden vereinfacht, Umweltstandards gelockert und neue Bohrlizenzen im Offshore-Bereich freigegeben. Für Exxon Mobil bedeutet das konkret: Schnellere und günstigere Produktionsfreigaben Neue Infrastrukturprojekte wie Pipelines und Terminals Steuererleichterungen und Subventionen auf Bundesebene Rückzug aus klimapolitischen Verpflichtungen (Pariser Abkommen) Gleichzeitig erhöht sich der politische Druck auf erneuerbare Energien – was die Marktposition klassischer Öl- und Gasunternehmen zusätzlich stärkt. Fundamentale Entwicklung und Perspektive Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 344 Mrd. USD 349 Mrd. USD 340 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 36,0 Mrd. USD 33,7 Mrd. USD 30,5 Mrd. USD KGV (2025e) ca. 14 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 3,8 Trotz schwächerer Ölpreise bleibt Exxon profitabel – auch dank effizienter Kostenstruktur, aggressiver Rückkäufe und wachsender Beteiligung an liquefied natural gas (LNG)-Projekten. Analysten sehen im Umfeld steigender globaler Nachfrage und nationaler Förderung weiteres Kurspotenzial. Anlegerfazit: Fossiler Champion mit politischem Schutzschild Exxon Mobil zählt zu den größten Gewinnern der neuen Energiepolitik in den USA. Der politische Rückenwind verstärkt die operative Stärke des Konzerns und macht ihn zu einem potenziellen Dauerläufer – auch in einem volatilen Marktumfeld. Trump-Faktor: Sehr hoch Risiken: Ölpreisabhängigkeit, geopolitische Spannungen Chancen: Genehmigungsschub, steuerliche Vorteile, Infrastruktur-Boom aktienchart von exxon mobil Exxon Mobil Aktienchart 2021 – 2025 / FinMent 3. Caterpillar Aktie: Infrastruktur-Maschine für Trumps Bauoffensive Caterpillar Inc. (ISIN: US1491231015 – Symbol: CAT – Währung: USD) Caterpillar ist der weltweit führende Hersteller von Baumaschinen, Diesel- und Gasmotoren, Industrieanlagen sowie Minenequipment. Das Unternehmen mit Sitz in Illinois gilt als konjunktursensitiver Schwergewichtsindex im US-Industriesektor – und ist eine Bau- und Infrastruktur-Aktie par excellence, mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 138 Milliarden US-Dollar (Stand: April 2025). Trumps Infrastrukturpolitik: America Builds Again Donald Trump hat bereits in seiner ersten Amtszeit Infrastrukturprojekte als zentrales Element seiner Wirtschaftspolitik propagiert – doch erst 2025 werden die Pläne massiv umgesetzt. Die neue Regierung kündigte ein 1-Billionen-US-Dollar-Programm zur Modernisierung von Straßen, Brücken, Pipelines und Energieinfrastruktur an. Caterpillar profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Staatliche Nachfrage nach Bau- und Erdbewegungsmaschinen Erleichterte Umweltauflagen für Bauprojekte Stärkung nationaler Lieferketten – Vorteil für US-Produktion Steuervorteile für Investitionen in Maschinen & Ausrüstung Fundamentale Entwicklung und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 67,1 Mrd. USD 71,5 Mrd. USD 75,2 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 9,2 Mrd. USD 10,0 Mrd. USD 10,6 Mrd. USD KGV (2025e) ca. 15 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 2,0 % Caterpillar ist nicht nur profitabel, sondern auch cashflow-stark. Die Nachfrage im US-Markt ist robust, die Book-to-Bill-Ratio in den Bereichen Bau & Mining liegt über 1 – ein Zeichen für solides Wachstum. Zusatztreiber: Deglobalisierung & Rohstoffwende Die protektionistische Handelspolitik der Trump-Regierung wirkt indirekt positiv auf Caterpillar. Denn mit steigenden Zöllen auf Maschinenimporte aus Europa und Asien gewinnen US-Produzenten an Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Gleichzeitig befeuert die globale Unsicherheit Investitionen in Energie- und Rohstoffgewinnung – ein weiteres Standbein für Caterpillar. Anlegerfazit: Realwirtschaftlicher Trump-Profiteur mit Substanz Caterpillar ist kein spekulativer Highflyer, sondern ein solider Konjunkturzykliker mit politischem Rückenwind. Wer auf reale Infrastrukturinvestitionen, Cashflows und US-zentriertes Wachstum setzen will, findet hier eine Trump-Aktie mit Substanz.

Oracle hat eine starke Position in der Technologiebranche und profitiert von der zunehmenden Digitalisierung und der Nachfrage nach skalierbaren Cloud-Diensten. Die Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „ORCL“ gehandelt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 360 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) spielt Oracle eine zentrale Rolle in der Entwicklung moderner IT-Infrastrukturen. Stargate: 500 Milliarden US-Dollar für Amerikas KI-Zukunft Donald Trump hat unmittelbar nach Amtsantritt ein Investitionsprogramm in Höhe von 500 Milliarden US-Dollar angekündigt, das den Ausbau der nationalen KI-Infrastruktur beschleunigen soll. Oracle ist – neben OpenAI und Softbank – einer der zentralen Technologiepartner. Was das konkret bedeutet: Großaufträge für Rechenzentren und Cloud-Kapazitäten Politische Unterstützung für inländische Datenverarbeitung Wegfall ethischer KI-Regulierung = höhere Innovationsgeschwindigkeit Positionierung als „Sicherheitsanbieter“ im Sinne nationaler Datensouveränität Oracle bringt mit seiner eigenen Cloud-Plattform (OCI – Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) und den weltweit genutzten Datenbanksystemen genau die Fähigkeiten mit, die jetzt politisch gewollt sind: schnell skalierbare Systeme, US-basiert und unter Kontrolle der Regierungspartner. Fundamentale Entwicklung und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 50,0 Mrd. USD 53,0 Mrd. USD 57,0 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 8,5 Mrd. USD 10,5 Mrd.

BONUS: Trump-Watchlist 2025 – Diese Aktien könnten ebenfalls profitieren Nicht alle Trump-Profiteure haben es in die Top 5 geschafft – doch einige spannende Kandidaten verdienen dennoch einen Platz auf Ihrer Watchlist: Tesla (TSLA) Elon Musk steht Trump politisch überraschend nahe. Sollte Tesla von steuerlichen Erleichterungen, Inlandsproduktion und Infrastrukturprojekten profitieren, könnte die Aktie ungeahnt Rückenwind erhalten – auch ohne direkte Beteiligung am Stargate-Programm. Palantir (PLTR) Das Datenanalyse-Unternehmen mit starken Regierungsbeziehungen könnte im Zuge wachsender Sicherheitsausgaben und nationaler IT-Projekte zusätzliche Aufträge gewinnen – besonders im Bereich KI-gestützter Verteidigung. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Als größter US-Finanzkonzern profitiert JPMorgan breit von Trumps Finanzagenda – von M&A-Fantasie bis zur Kreditvergabe in der Infrastruktur. Lennar & D.R. Horton (LEN, DHI) Die beiden US-Baukonzerne könnten stark von Trumps Wohnungsbauoffensive profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten durch Einwanderungsregulierung. Deere & Company (DE) Als Hersteller von Land- und Baumaschinen ist Deere ein direkter Gewinner nationaler Infrastrukturprojekte – und könnte durch Importzölle auf ausländische Maschinen Marktanteile gewinnen. Hinweis: Diese Aktien sind spekulativer als die Top 5 – bieten aber unter Trumps politischer Agenda gezielte Chancen, vor allem im Bereich Technologie, Bau und nationale Sicherheit.","https://finment.com/boerse-aktien/us-aktien/top-donald-trump-aktien/"

Picture of Adrian Schmid Adrian Schmid | Letzte Aktualisierung am 8.04.2025 Mit seinem Zollhammer erschüttert Donald Trump die globale Wirtschaft – und die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit einem historischen Schockmoment. Seit dem 5. April 2025 gelten in den USA flächendeckende Importzölle von mindestens 10 Prozent, für Produkte aus China sogar 34 Prozent – mit der Drohung, diese um weitere 50 Prozent zu erhöhen. Diese Drohung ist bereits einen Tag später eingetreten – 104 Prozent Zölle gegen China! Die Folge? Ein Blutbad an den Börsen: Der Nasdaq stürzt in nur drei Handelstagen um über 16 Prozent ab Der S&P 500 verliert 15 Prozent Der DAX fällt sogar um 17 Prozent Rohstoffe wie WTI-Öl und Silber rauschen um bis zu 21 Prozent nach unten Der VIX explodiert auf über 60 – Angst dominiert die Wall Street Der Fear & Greed Index steht bei 4: Extreme Fear. Die Aktienmärkte stehen unter Schock – und doch: Mitten im Chaos entstehen neue Chancen. Denn während viele Exporteure, Konsumriesen und Big Tech-Aktien unter Druck geraten, profitieren andere direkt von Trumps Agenda. In diesem Artikel analysieren wir die Top 5 Donald Trump Aktien 2025 – Unternehmen, die vom neuen wirtschaftspolitischen Kurs profitieren könnten: durch nationale Investitionen, steuerliche Entlastungen und gezielte Branchenförderung. Welche Aktien könnten jetzt zur neuen Marktelite aufsteigen – und welche Rolle kann der „Trump-Turbo“ in Ihrem Depot spielen? Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt mit einem crash und börsenbeben, wahl sieg Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt / Shutterstock Donald Trumps Zollhammer 2025: So verändert der US-Präsident den Welthandel Was zunächst wie wirtschaftspolitischer Wahnsinn wirkt, folgt einer klaren Logik: US Präsident Donald Trump will die Vereinigten Staaten zur Festung der Produktion machen. Mit dem pauschalen Importzoll von mindestens 10 Prozent auf alle Waren (seit 5. April 2025) beginnt die Umsetzung seiner protektionistischen Vision einer „autarken Supermacht“. Besonders hart trifft es Länder mit hohen Handelsüberschüssen gegenüber den USA – allen voran China, das mit einer Zollbelastung von insgesamt 54 Prozent konfrontiert ist. Doch auch Deutschland, Japan, Kanada, Vietnam und die Schweiz spüren die neue Zollpolitik deutlich. Der US-Präsident hat klargemacht: Wer amerikanische Produkte blockiert oder unterbietet, zahlt den Preis. Was das bedeutet: Zollankündigung EU-Zölle: 20 Prozent Japan: 25 Prozent auf Autos, 24 Prozent auf Konsumgüter Kanada: 25 Prozent auf nicht in den USA hergestellte Autos Schweiz: 31 Prozent China: 34 Prozent + mögliche Aufstockung auf 50 Prozent Für über 40 Länder gelten Sonderzölle zwischen 30 und 50 Prozent – darunter viele asiatische und afrikanische Staaten. Gleichzeitig läuft eine 51-tägige Übergangsfrist, die bis zum 27. Mai 2025 für Waren gilt, die vor dem Stichtag verschifft wurden. Trumps strategisches Ziel: Handelsbilanz verbessern US-Produktion reindustrialisieren Abhängigkeiten von China & Europa verringern Neue Investitionsanreize im Inland schaffen Ergänzt wird der Zollhammer durch gezielte Ausnahmen für „kritische Rohstoffe und Technologien“ wie Halbleiter, Kupfer oder Arzneimittel – doch selbst diese könnten bald unter Trumps nächste Zollrunde fallen. Zwischenfazit: Trump nutzt den Zoll als geopolitisches und wirtschaftliches Werkzeug – nicht nur zur Machtdemonstration, sondern um gezielt Wachstum zurück in die USA zu zwingen. Für global aufgestellte Unternehmen ist das eine Herausforderung – für national fokussierte US-Konzerne eine historische Chance. DAX, Nasdaq & Co im freien Fall – Was jetzt nach dem Trump-Schock zählt Die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit beispielloser Wucht auf Trumps Zolloffensive – der sogenannte „Trump-Schock 2.0“ entfaltet seine volle Wucht. Innerhalb von nur drei Handelstagen erleben Anleger ein Szenario, das selbst krisenerprobte Marktteilnehmer sprachlos macht: Indizes im freien Fall Nasdaq Composite: –16 Prozent S&P 500: –15 Prozent DAX: –17 Prozent Rohstoffe brechen ein WTI-Öl: –18 Prozent Silber: –21 Prozent Panikindikatoren schlagen Alarm Volatilitätsindex VIX: springt auf über 60 Punkte – der zweithöchste Stand seit dem Corona-Crash Fear & Greed Index: fällt auf 4 von 100 – ein klares Signal für Extreme Fear Was wir erleben, ist nicht nur ein Börsenrücksetzer, sondern ein fundamentaler Stimmungsumschwung. Anleger fliehen aus Risikoassets, verkaufen Tech-Giganten und meiden exportorientierte Geschäftsmodelle. Der globale Kapitalstrom kehrt sich um – weg von Internationalisierung, hin zur nationalen Robustheit. Doch mitten im Tumult beginnt das große Umdenken: Denn während Exporteure taumeln, gewinnen andere an Stärke. US-Unternehmen mit starker Inlandsfokussierung, politischer Rückendeckung und direkter Nähe zu Trumps strategischer Agenda rücken plötzlich ins Zentrum des Anlegerinteresses. trump zoll ankündigung, sturm an den aktienmärken, handelskrieg Trump Zollkrieg / Shutterstock Was jetzt zählt: Wer liefert Stabilität im Inland? Wer profitiert von Staatsaufträgen, Deregulierung und Investitionen? Wer kann unter Trump schneller wachsen – weil die Regeln gelockert sind? Der Markt preist nicht nur Angst ein – er beginnt, neue Gewinner zu suchen. Diese Sektoren sind die neuen Gewinner unter Donald Trump – Aktien mit Potenzial Mit Zöllen, Deregulierung und milliardenschweren Investitionen hat Donald Trump die Spielregeln an der Börse neu definiert. Seine Wirtschaftspolitik belohnt nicht Internationalität, sondern strategischen Patriotismus: Wer in den USA produziert, sich auf das Heimatland fokussiert oder Trumps Agenda bedient, hat plötzlich die Nase vorn. Inmitten der Turbulenzen kristallisieren sich fünf Schlüsselbranchen heraus, die nun politisch priorisiert und finanziell begünstigt werden – und damit zu den neuen Hoffnungsträgern der Märkte avancieren könnten: 1. Verteidigung: Sicherheit wird wieder zur Aktienstory Was Trump will: Einen starken militärischen Industriekomplex. Das Verteidigungsbudget wächst um 80 Milliarden US-Dollar. Der Fokus liegt auf nationaler Unabhängigkeit, technologischem Vorsprung und militärischer Dominanz. Was die Märkte sehen: Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman und General Dynamics stehen am Anfang einer neuen Auftragswelle – von Hyperschallwaffen über Luftverteidigung bis zu autonomen Systemen. Analysten erwarten Milliardenaufträge im zweistelligen Bereich. Anlegerfazit: Planbare Umsätze, politische Priorität, hohe Eintrittsbarrieren. Verteidigung ist unter Trump kein Randthema – sie ist ein Investmenttrend. 2. Energie: Fossil wird wieder strategisch Was Trump will: Volle Energieunabhängigkeit. Öl, Gas, Kohle und Uran sollen Amerikas Grundversorgung sichern – nicht Windräder und Solarpanels aus China. Was die Märkte sehen: Exxon Mobil und Chevron profitieren von beschleunigten Genehmigungen, während Uranium Energy durch die Renaissance der Kernkraft neues Potenzial bekommt. Der Rohstoffmarkt dreht – nicht trotz, sondern wegen geopolitischer Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wachstum durch politische Rückendeckung. Trumps Energiepolitik favorisiert Konzerne mit US-Fokus und eigener Produktion. Ein Comeback fossiler Werte zeichnet sich ab. 3. Technologie & KI: Made in USA statt global Was Trump will: Die digitale Vorherrschaft der USA – unabhängig von europäischen Ethikregeln oder chinesischer Hardware. Das Stargate-Programm in Höhe von 500 Milliarden US-Dollar ist Ausdruck dieser Ambition. Was die Märkte sehen: Oracle als direkter Stargate-Partner profitiert ebenso wie Nvidia, Microsoft oder Palantir. Die Abschaffung regulatorischer Schranken könnte zusätzlich die Innovationsgeschwindigkeit erhöhen – wenn auch mit Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wer in KI investiert, investiert in die neue „digitale Infrastruktur Amerikas“. Trump verleiht dem Sektor nicht nur Budget, sondern auch narrative Schlagkraft. 4. Infrastruktur & Bau: Die Betonwende Was Trump will: Bauen, sichern, modernisieren. Straßen, Zäune, Wohnungen. Bauwirtschaft als Wachstumsanker und Jobmaschine. Was die Märkte sehen: Lennar, D.R. Horton und Caterpillar könnten von staatlichen Großprojekten profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten infolge verschärfter Immigration. Maschinenbauer wie Deere rücken ebenfalls in den Fokus. Anlegerfazit: Infrastrukturunternehmen mit US-Präsenz erhalten direkten Zugang zu Staatsaufträgen – ein klassisches Trump-Muster: Innen vor Außen. 5. Finanzen: Deregulierung Reloaded Was Trump will: Kapitalfreisetzung durch Steuererleichterungen, weniger Bürokratie und neue Anreize für M&A-Aktivitäten. Was die Märkte sehen: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan und Blackstone positionieren sich früh. Der M&A-Boom ist realistisch – ebenso wie steigende Margen im Trading und der Vermögensverwaltung. Anlegerfazit: Banken erleben ein Comeback der Deregulierung. Wer auf Transaktionen, Kreditvergabe und Asset Management setzt, könnte im Finanzsektor neue Erträge erschließen. Strategisches Zwischenfazit für Anleger: Die Politik bestimmt die Börsenordnung neu. Und Anleger, die Trumps Agenda frühzeitig verstehen, können gezielt profitieren. Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Verteidigung Aufrüstung, Sicherheit Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman Energie Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe Exxon, Chevron, Uranium Energy Technologie Stargate, KI-Förderung Oracle, Nvidia, Palanti Infrastruktur Bauprojekte, US-Subventionen Caterpillar, Lennar, D.R. Horton Finanzen Deregulierung, Steuern Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone Der Trump-Turbo für Anleger: Alternative Anlageformen wie ETFs Nicht jeder Privatanleger möchte oder kann gezielt einzelne US-Aktien auswählen, die potenziell von Trumps Politik profitieren. Eine interessante Alternative stellt hier ein Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) dar, der eine breite Streuung und Risikominderung ermöglicht. Durch den Kauf eines US-Aktien-ETFs lässt sich das Kapital auf viele amerikanische Unternehmen verteilen, wodurch man das Potenzial des gesamten US-Marktes nutzen und gleichzeitig das Risiko durch Diversifikation minimieren kann. Ein besonders attraktiver ETF für Börsianer, die am US-Markt partizipieren möchten, ist der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF (ISIN: IE00B3XXRP09). Dieser ETF bildet den S&P 500 Index ab, der die 500 größten US-Unternehmen umfasst. So können Investoren breit gestreut in die US-Wirtschaft investieren, ohne auf einzelne Aktien setzen zu müssen. Der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF hat eine Marktkapitalisierung von ca. 34,6 Milliarden USD (Stand 07.04.2025) und legt seinen Schwerpunkt auf die Branchen Technologie (33,5 Prozent), Finanzwesen (11,0 Prozent), Nicht-Basiskonsumgüter (10,8 Prozent), Gesundheitswesen (10,3 Prozent), in denen sich besonders viele Trump-begünstigte Unternehmen befinden könnten. Beispielsweise sind Schwergewichte wie Apple (7,0 Prozent), Microsoft (6,1 Prozent) und NVIDIA (6,6 Prozent) im ETF enthalten, was Anlegern Zugang zu den größten und profitabelsten Unternehmen der USA verschafft. Der ETF überzeugt zudem durch niedrige Gebühren: Die Gesamtkostenquote (Total Expense Ratio, TER) liegt bei nur 0,07 Prozent pro Jahr. Dividenden werden quartalsweise ausgeschüttet, wie zuletzt im März 2025 (0,30 USD je Anteil), was Anlegern einen zusätzlichen Ertrag ermöglicht. Trotz der attraktiven Möglichkeiten, die ein US-Aktien ETF wie der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF bietet, sollten Anleger jedoch darauf achten, nicht ihr gesamtes Kapital ausschließlich in den US-Markt zu investieren. ETFs auf internationale Märkte können helfen, die Volatilität zu reduzieren und das Risiko weiter zu streuen. Weitere ETFs für Ihren Vermögensaufbau finden Sie hier Beste ETFs.

Die Firma ist bekannt für die Entwicklung und Produktion fortschrittlicher Technologien, darunter Kampfflugzeuge, Raketenabwehrsysteme und Satelliten.

Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 101 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) spielt Lockheed Martin eine zentrale Rolle in der globalen Verteidigungsindustrie. luft und raumfahrt: foto von lockheed martin aktie, flugzeug betankt in der luft ein kampfjet f 35, rüstungs aktien, rolls royce Luftbetankung eines Kampfjets / Lockheed Martin Warum Lockheed Martin unter Trump besonders profitiert Donald Trump hat nach seiner Rückkehr ins Amt die Verteidigungsausgaben massiv erhöht – zusätzlich 80 Milliarden US-Dollar für Modernisierung, Luftverteidigung und Hyperschallwaffen. In mehreren Reden betonte er, dass die militärische Überlegenheit der USA „wieder höchste Priorität“ habe. Lockheed Martin ist bereits heute mit über 70 Prozent seines Umsatzes vom US-Militär abhängig – und dürfte damit direkt von den neuen Großaufträgen profitieren. Im Fokus: Neue F-35-Serien Hyperschall-Raketen (Prompt Strike) Raumfahrtprogramme autonome Überwachungs- und Abwehrsysteme Strategischer Trumpf: Technologischer Vorsprung Trumps Regierung will die Abhängigkeit von ausländischer Verteidigungstechnik reduzieren und verstärkt auf nationale Beschaffung setzen. Als führender Anbieter von High-End-Systemen genießt Lockheed Martin hier eine herausragende Position – technologisch, politisch und organisatorisch. Fundamentale Kennzahlen und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 67,6 Mrd. USD 71,0 Mrd. USD 74,3 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 6,9 Mrd. USD 5,3 Mrd.

USD KGV (2025e) ca. 16 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 3,1 % Analysten sehen weiteres Kurspotenzial, insbesondere wenn Trumps Pläne für Hyperschallwaffen und unbemannte Systeme zügig umgesetzt werden. Die Cashflows gelten als stabil, das Geschäftsmodell als defensiv robust. Anlegerfazit: Sicherheitsaktie mit politischem Rückenwind Lockheed Martin zählt zu den klaren Profiteuren der Trump-Politik. Wer auf berechenbare Regierungsaufträge, politische Priorität und technologische Führungsrolle setzen will, findet hier eine Aktie mit hoher Sichtbarkeit und langfristiger Perspektive. Trump-Faktor: Hoch Risiken: politische Abhängigkeit, internationale Auftragseinbrüche bei Spannungsanstieg Chancen: Milliardenaufträge, technologische Führerschaft, globale Nachfrage nach Sicherheit aktienchart von lockheed martin Lockheed Martin Aktienchart 2021 – 2025 / FinMent 4. Exxon Mobil Aktie: Neue Chancen durch Trumps Energiepolitik Exxon Mobil Corporation (ISIN: US30231G1022 – Symbol: XOM – Währung: USD) Die Exxon Mobil Corporation, mit Hauptsitz in Irving, Texas, ist eines der weltweit führenden Unternehmen in der Öl- und Gasindustrie. Das Unternehmen deckt die gesamte Wertschöpfungskette ab – von der Exploration über die Produktion bis hin zur Raffination und dem Vertrieb von Erdöl und Erdgas. Die Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „XOM“ gehandelt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 453 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) gehört Exxon Mobil zu den Schwergewichten im Energiesektor und hat eine herausragende Position auf dem globalen Markt. Trumps Energieagenda: Förderung statt Verzicht Donald Trump hat nach seiner Amtseinführung einen nationalen Energienotstand ausgerufen und der Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe höchste Priorität eingeräumt. Genehmigungsverfahren wurden vereinfacht, Umweltstandards gelockert und neue Bohrlizenzen im Offshore-Bereich freigegeben. Für Exxon Mobil bedeutet das konkret: Schnellere und günstigere Produktionsfreigaben Neue Infrastrukturprojekte wie Pipelines und Terminals Steuererleichterungen und Subventionen auf Bundesebene Rückzug aus klimapolitischen Verpflichtungen (Pariser Abkommen) Gleichzeitig erhöht sich der politische Druck auf erneuerbare Energien – was die Marktposition klassischer Öl- und Gasunternehmen zusätzlich stärkt. Fundamentale Entwicklung und Perspektive Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 344 Mrd. USD 349 Mrd. USD 340 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 36,0 Mrd. USD 33,7 Mrd. USD 30,5 Mrd. USD KGV (2025e) ca. 14 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 3,8 Trotz schwächerer Ölpreise bleibt Exxon profitabel – auch dank effizienter Kostenstruktur, aggressiver Rückkäufe und wachsender Beteiligung an liquefied natural gas (LNG)-Projekten. Analysten sehen im Umfeld steigender globaler Nachfrage und nationaler Förderung weiteres Kurspotenzial. Anlegerfazit: Fossiler Champion mit politischem Schutzschild Exxon Mobil zählt zu den größten Gewinnern der neuen Energiepolitik in den USA. Der politische Rückenwind verstärkt die operative Stärke des Konzerns und macht ihn zu einem potenziellen Dauerläufer – auch in einem volatilen Marktumfeld. Trump-Faktor: Sehr hoch Risiken: Ölpreisabhängigkeit, geopolitische Spannungen Chancen: Genehmigungsschub, steuerliche Vorteile, Infrastruktur-Boom aktienchart von exxon mobil Exxon Mobil Aktienchart 2021 – 2025 / FinMent 3. Caterpillar Aktie: Infrastruktur-Maschine für Trumps Bauoffensive Caterpillar Inc. (ISIN: US1491231015 – Symbol: CAT – Währung: USD) Caterpillar ist der weltweit führende Hersteller von Baumaschinen, Diesel- und Gasmotoren, Industrieanlagen sowie Minenequipment. Das Unternehmen mit Sitz in Illinois gilt als konjunktursensitiver Schwergewichtsindex im US-Industriesektor – und ist eine Bau- und Infrastruktur-Aktie par excellence, mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 138 Milliarden US-Dollar (Stand: April 2025). Trumps Infrastrukturpolitik: America Builds Again Donald Trump hat bereits in seiner ersten Amtszeit Infrastrukturprojekte als zentrales Element seiner Wirtschaftspolitik propagiert – doch erst 2025 werden die Pläne massiv umgesetzt. Die neue Regierung kündigte ein 1-Billionen-US-Dollar-Programm zur Modernisierung von Straßen, Brücken, Pipelines und Energieinfrastruktur an. Caterpillar profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Staatliche Nachfrage nach Bau- und Erdbewegungsmaschinen Erleichterte Umweltauflagen für Bauprojekte Stärkung nationaler Lieferketten – Vorteil für US-Produktion Steuervorteile für Investitionen in Maschinen & Ausrüstung Fundamentale Entwicklung und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 67,1 Mrd. USD 71,5 Mrd. USD 75,2 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 9,2 Mrd. USD 10,0 Mrd. USD 10,6 Mrd. USD KGV (2025e) ca. 15 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 2,0 % Caterpillar ist nicht nur profitabel, sondern auch cashflow-stark. Die Nachfrage im US-Markt ist robust, die Book-to-Bill-Ratio in den Bereichen Bau & Mining liegt über 1 – ein Zeichen für solides Wachstum. Zusatztreiber: Deglobalisierung & Rohstoffwende Die protektionistische Handelspolitik der Trump-Regierung wirkt indirekt positiv auf Caterpillar. Denn mit steigenden Zöllen auf Maschinenimporte aus Europa und Asien gewinnen US-Produzenten an Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Gleichzeitig befeuert die globale Unsicherheit Investitionen in Energie- und Rohstoffgewinnung – ein weiteres Standbein für Caterpillar. Anlegerfazit: Realwirtschaftlicher Trump-Profiteur mit Substanz Caterpillar ist kein spekulativer Highflyer, sondern ein solider Konjunkturzykliker mit politischem Rückenwind. Wer auf reale Infrastrukturinvestitionen, Cashflows und US-zentriertes Wachstum setzen will, findet hier eine Trump-Aktie mit Substanz.

Die Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „ORCL“ gehandelt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 360 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) spielt Oracle eine zentrale Rolle in der Entwicklung moderner IT-Infrastrukturen. Stargate: 500 Milliarden US-Dollar für Amerikas KI-Zukunft Donald Trump hat unmittelbar nach Amtsantritt ein Investitionsprogramm in Höhe von 500 Milliarden US-Dollar angekündigt, das den Ausbau der nationalen KI-Infrastruktur beschleunigen soll. Oracle ist – neben OpenAI und Softbank – einer der zentralen Technologiepartner. Was das konkret bedeutet: Großaufträge für Rechenzentren und Cloud-Kapazitäten Politische Unterstützung für inländische Datenverarbeitung Wegfall ethischer KI-Regulierung = höhere Innovationsgeschwindigkeit Positionierung als „Sicherheitsanbieter“ im Sinne nationaler Datensouveränität Oracle bringt mit seiner eigenen Cloud-Plattform (OCI – Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) und den weltweit genutzten Datenbanksystemen genau die Fähigkeiten mit, die jetzt politisch gewollt sind: schnell skalierbare Systeme, US-basiert und unter Kontrolle der Regierungspartner. Fundamentale Entwicklung und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 50,0 Mrd. USD 53,0 Mrd. USD 57,0 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 8,5 Mrd. USD 10,5 Mrd.

BONUS: Trump-Watchlist 2025 – Diese Aktien könnten ebenfalls profitieren Nicht alle Trump-Profiteure haben es in die Top 5 geschafft – doch einige spannende Kandidaten verdienen dennoch einen Platz auf Ihrer Watchlist: Tesla (TSLA) Elon Musk steht Trump politisch überraschend nahe. Sollte Tesla von steuerlichen Erleichterungen, Inlandsproduktion und Infrastrukturprojekten profitieren, könnte die Aktie ungeahnt Rückenwind erhalten – auch ohne direkte Beteiligung am Stargate-Programm. Palantir (PLTR) Das Datenanalyse-Unternehmen mit starken Regierungsbeziehungen könnte im Zuge wachsender Sicherheitsausgaben und nationaler IT-Projekte zusätzliche Aufträge gewinnen – besonders im Bereich KI-gestützter Verteidigung. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Als größter US-Finanzkonzern profitiert JPMorgan breit von Trumps Finanzagenda – von M&A-Fantasie bis zur Kreditvergabe in der Infrastruktur. Lennar & D.R. Horton (LEN, DHI) Die beiden US-Baukonzerne könnten stark von Trumps Wohnungsbauoffensive profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten durch Einwanderungsregulierung. Deere & Company (DE) Als Hersteller von Land- und Baumaschinen ist Deere ein direkter Gewinner nationaler Infrastrukturprojekte – und könnte durch Importzölle auf ausländische Maschinen Marktanteile gewinnen. Hinweis: Diese Aktien sind spekulativer als die Top 5 – bieten aber unter Trumps politischer Agenda gezielte Chancen, vor allem im Bereich Technologie, Bau und nationale Sicherheit.","https://finment.com/boerse-aktien/us-aktien/top-donald-trump-aktien/"

Picture of Adrian Schmid Adrian Schmid | Letzte Aktualisierung am 8.04.2025 Mit seinem Zollhammer erschüttert Donald Trump die globale Wirtschaft – und die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit einem historischen Schockmoment. Seit dem 5. April 2025 gelten in den USA flächendeckende Importzölle von mindestens 10 Prozent, für Produkte aus China sogar 34 Prozent – mit der Drohung, diese um weitere 50 Prozent zu erhöhen. Diese Drohung ist bereits einen Tag später eingetreten – 104 Prozent Zölle gegen China! Die Folge? Ein Blutbad an den Börsen: Der Nasdaq stürzt in nur drei Handelstagen um über 16 Prozent ab Der S&P 500 verliert 15 Prozent Der DAX fällt sogar um 17 Prozent Rohstoffe wie WTI-Öl und Silber rauschen um bis zu 21 Prozent nach unten Der VIX explodiert auf über 60 – Angst dominiert die Wall Street Der Fear & Greed Index steht bei 4: Extreme Fear. Die Aktienmärkte stehen unter Schock – und doch: Mitten im Chaos entstehen neue Chancen. Denn während viele Exporteure, Konsumriesen und Big Tech-Aktien unter Druck geraten, profitieren andere direkt von Trumps Agenda. In diesem Artikel analysieren wir die Top 5 Donald Trump Aktien 2025 – Unternehmen, die vom neuen wirtschaftspolitischen Kurs profitieren könnten: durch nationale Investitionen, steuerliche Entlastungen und gezielte Branchenförderung. Welche Aktien könnten jetzt zur neuen Marktelite aufsteigen – und welche Rolle kann der „Trump-Turbo“ in Ihrem Depot spielen? Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt mit einem crash und börsenbeben, wahl sieg Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt / Shutterstock Donald Trumps Zollhammer 2025: So verändert der US-Präsident den Welthandel Was zunächst wie wirtschaftspolitischer Wahnsinn wirkt, folgt einer klaren Logik: US Präsident Donald Trump will die Vereinigten Staaten zur Festung der Produktion machen. Mit dem pauschalen Importzoll von mindestens 10 Prozent auf alle Waren (seit 5. April 2025) beginnt die Umsetzung seiner protektionistischen Vision einer „autarken Supermacht“. Besonders hart trifft es Länder mit hohen Handelsüberschüssen gegenüber den USA – allen voran China, das mit einer Zollbelastung von insgesamt 54 Prozent konfrontiert ist. Doch auch Deutschland, Japan, Kanada, Vietnam und die Schweiz spüren die neue Zollpolitik deutlich. Der US-Präsident hat klargemacht: Wer amerikanische Produkte blockiert oder unterbietet, zahlt den Preis. Was das bedeutet: Zollankündigung EU-Zölle: 20 Prozent Japan: 25 Prozent auf Autos, 24 Prozent auf Konsumgüter Kanada: 25 Prozent auf nicht in den USA hergestellte Autos Schweiz: 31 Prozent China: 34 Prozent + mögliche Aufstockung auf 50 Prozent Für über 40 Länder gelten Sonderzölle zwischen 30 und 50 Prozent – darunter viele asiatische und afrikanische Staaten. Gleichzeitig läuft eine 51-tägige Übergangsfrist, die bis zum 27. Mai 2025 für Waren gilt, die vor dem Stichtag verschifft wurden. Trumps strategisches Ziel: Handelsbilanz verbessern US-Produktion reindustrialisieren Abhängigkeiten von China & Europa verringern Neue Investitionsanreize im Inland schaffen Ergänzt wird der Zollhammer durch gezielte Ausnahmen für „kritische Rohstoffe und Technologien“ wie Halbleiter, Kupfer oder Arzneimittel – doch selbst diese könnten bald unter Trumps nächste Zollrunde fallen. Zwischenfazit: Trump nutzt den Zoll als geopolitisches und wirtschaftliches Werkzeug – nicht nur zur Machtdemonstration, sondern um gezielt Wachstum zurück in die USA zu zwingen. Für global aufgestellte Unternehmen ist das eine Herausforderung – für national fokussierte US-Konzerne eine historische Chance. DAX, Nasdaq & Co im freien Fall – Was jetzt nach dem Trump-Schock zählt Die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit beispielloser Wucht auf Trumps Zolloffensive – der sogenannte „Trump-Schock 2.0“ entfaltet seine volle Wucht. Innerhalb von nur drei Handelstagen erleben Anleger ein Szenario, das selbst krisenerprobte Marktteilnehmer sprachlos macht: Indizes im freien Fall Nasdaq Composite: –16 Prozent S&P 500: –15 Prozent DAX: –17 Prozent Rohstoffe brechen ein WTI-Öl: –18 Prozent Silber: –21 Prozent Panikindikatoren schlagen Alarm Volatilitätsindex VIX: springt auf über 60 Punkte – der zweithöchste Stand seit dem Corona-Crash Fear & Greed Index: fällt auf 4 von 100 – ein klares Signal für Extreme Fear Was wir erleben, ist nicht nur ein Börsenrücksetzer, sondern ein fundamentaler Stimmungsumschwung. Anleger fliehen aus Risikoassets, verkaufen Tech-Giganten und meiden exportorientierte Geschäftsmodelle. Der globale Kapitalstrom kehrt sich um – weg von Internationalisierung, hin zur nationalen Robustheit. Doch mitten im Tumult beginnt das große Umdenken: Denn während Exporteure taumeln, gewinnen andere an Stärke. US-Unternehmen mit starker Inlandsfokussierung, politischer Rückendeckung und direkter Nähe zu Trumps strategischer Agenda rücken plötzlich ins Zentrum des Anlegerinteresses. trump zoll ankündigung, sturm an den aktienmärken, handelskrieg Trump Zollkrieg / Shutterstock Was jetzt zählt: Wer liefert Stabilität im Inland? Wer profitiert von Staatsaufträgen, Deregulierung und Investitionen? Wer kann unter Trump schneller wachsen – weil die Regeln gelockert sind? Der Markt preist nicht nur Angst ein – er beginnt, neue Gewinner zu suchen. Diese Sektoren sind die neuen Gewinner unter Donald Trump – Aktien mit Potenzial Mit Zöllen, Deregulierung und milliardenschweren Investitionen hat Donald Trump die Spielregeln an der Börse neu definiert. Seine Wirtschaftspolitik belohnt nicht Internationalität, sondern strategischen Patriotismus: Wer in den USA produziert, sich auf das Heimatland fokussiert oder Trumps Agenda bedient, hat plötzlich die Nase vorn. Inmitten der Turbulenzen kristallisieren sich fünf Schlüsselbranchen heraus, die nun politisch priorisiert und finanziell begünstigt werden – und damit zu den neuen Hoffnungsträgern der Märkte avancieren könnten: 1. Verteidigung: Sicherheit wird wieder zur Aktienstory Was Trump will: Einen starken militärischen Industriekomplex. Das Verteidigungsbudget wächst um 80 Milliarden US-Dollar. Der Fokus liegt auf nationaler Unabhängigkeit, technologischem Vorsprung und militärischer Dominanz. Was die Märkte sehen: Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman und General Dynamics stehen am Anfang einer neuen Auftragswelle – von Hyperschallwaffen über Luftverteidigung bis zu autonomen Systemen. Analysten erwarten Milliardenaufträge im zweistelligen Bereich. Anlegerfazit: Planbare Umsätze, politische Priorität, hohe Eintrittsbarrieren. Verteidigung ist unter Trump kein Randthema – sie ist ein Investmenttrend. 2. Energie: Fossil wird wieder strategisch Was Trump will: Volle Energieunabhängigkeit. Öl, Gas, Kohle und Uran sollen Amerikas Grundversorgung sichern – nicht Windräder und Solarpanels aus China. Was die Märkte sehen: Exxon Mobil und Chevron profitieren von beschleunigten Genehmigungen, während Uranium Energy durch die Renaissance der Kernkraft neues Potenzial bekommt. Der Rohstoffmarkt dreht – nicht trotz, sondern wegen geopolitischer Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wachstum durch politische Rückendeckung. Trumps Energiepolitik favorisiert Konzerne mit US-Fokus und eigener Produktion. Ein Comeback fossiler Werte zeichnet sich ab. 3. Technologie & KI: Made in USA statt global Was Trump will: Die digitale Vorherrschaft der USA – unabhängig von europäischen Ethikregeln oder chinesischer Hardware. Das Stargate-Programm in Höhe von 500 Milliarden US-Dollar ist Ausdruck dieser Ambition. Was die Märkte sehen: Oracle als direkter Stargate-Partner profitiert ebenso wie Nvidia, Microsoft oder Palantir. Die Abschaffung regulatorischer Schranken könnte zusätzlich die Innovationsgeschwindigkeit erhöhen – wenn auch mit Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wer in KI investiert, investiert in die neue „digitale Infrastruktur Amerikas“. Trump verleiht dem Sektor nicht nur Budget, sondern auch narrative Schlagkraft. 4. Infrastruktur & Bau: Die Betonwende Was Trump will: Bauen, sichern, modernisieren. Straßen, Zäune, Wohnungen. Bauwirtschaft als Wachstumsanker und Jobmaschine. Was die Märkte sehen: Lennar, D.R. Horton und Caterpillar könnten von staatlichen Großprojekten profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten infolge verschärfter Immigration. Maschinenbauer wie Deere rücken ebenfalls in den Fokus. Anlegerfazit: Infrastrukturunternehmen mit US-Präsenz erhalten direkten Zugang zu Staatsaufträgen – ein klassisches Trump-Muster: Innen vor Außen. 5. Finanzen: Deregulierung Reloaded Was Trump will: Kapitalfreisetzung durch Steuererleichterungen, weniger Bürokratie und neue Anreize für M&A-Aktivitäten. Was die Märkte sehen: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan und Blackstone positionieren sich früh. Der M&A-Boom ist realistisch – ebenso wie steigende Margen im Trading und der Vermögensverwaltung. Anlegerfazit: Banken erleben ein Comeback der Deregulierung. Wer auf Transaktionen, Kreditvergabe und Asset Management setzt, könnte im Finanzsektor neue Erträge erschließen. Strategisches Zwischenfazit für Anleger: Die Politik bestimmt die Börsenordnung neu. Und Anleger, die Trumps Agenda frühzeitig verstehen, können gezielt profitieren. Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Verteidigung Aufrüstung, Sicherheit Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman Energie Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe Exxon, Chevron, Uranium Energy Technologie Stargate, KI-Förderung Oracle, Nvidia, Palanti Infrastruktur Bauprojekte, US-Subventionen Caterpillar, Lennar, D.R. Horton Finanzen Deregulierung, Steuern Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone Der Trump-Turbo für Anleger: Alternative Anlageformen wie ETFs Nicht jeder Privatanleger möchte oder kann gezielt einzelne US-Aktien auswählen, die potenziell von Trumps Politik profitieren. Eine interessante Alternative stellt hier ein Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) dar, der eine breite Streuung und Risikominderung ermöglicht. Durch den Kauf eines US-Aktien-ETFs lässt sich das Kapital auf viele amerikanische Unternehmen verteilen, wodurch man das Potenzial des gesamten US-Marktes nutzen und gleichzeitig das Risiko durch Diversifikation minimieren kann. Ein besonders attraktiver ETF für Börsianer, die am US-Markt partizipieren möchten, ist der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF (ISIN: IE00B3XXRP09). Dieser ETF bildet den S&P 500 Index ab, der die 500 größten US-Unternehmen umfasst. So können Investoren breit gestreut in die US-Wirtschaft investieren, ohne auf einzelne Aktien setzen zu müssen. Der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF hat eine Marktkapitalisierung von ca. 34,6 Milliarden USD (Stand 07.04.2025) und legt seinen Schwerpunkt auf die Branchen Technologie (33,5 Prozent), Finanzwesen (11,0 Prozent), Nicht-Basiskonsumgüter (10,8 Prozent), Gesundheitswesen (10,3 Prozent), in denen sich besonders viele Trump-begünstigte Unternehmen befinden könnten. Beispielsweise sind Schwergewichte wie Apple (7,0 Prozent), Microsoft (6,1 Prozent) und NVIDIA (6,6 Prozent) im ETF enthalten, was Anlegern Zugang zu den größten und profitabelsten Unternehmen der USA verschafft. Der ETF überzeugt zudem durch niedrige Gebühren: Die Gesamtkostenquote (Total Expense Ratio, TER) liegt bei nur 0,07 Prozent pro Jahr. Dividenden werden quartalsweise ausgeschüttet, wie zuletzt im März 2025 (0,30 USD je Anteil), was Anlegern einen zusätzlichen Ertrag ermöglicht. Trotz der attraktiven Möglichkeiten, die ein US-Aktien ETF wie der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF bietet, sollten Anleger jedoch darauf achten, nicht ihr gesamtes Kapital ausschließlich in den US-Markt zu investieren. ETFs auf internationale Märkte können helfen, die Volatilität zu reduzieren und das Risiko weiter zu streuen. Weitere ETFs für Ihren Vermögensaufbau finden Sie hier Beste ETFs.

Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 101 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) spielt Lockheed Martin eine zentrale Rolle in der globalen Verteidigungsindustrie. luft und raumfahrt: foto von lockheed martin aktie, flugzeug betankt in der luft ein kampfjet f 35, rüstungs aktien, rolls royce Luftbetankung eines Kampfjets / Lockheed Martin Warum Lockheed Martin unter Trump besonders profitiert Donald Trump hat nach seiner Rückkehr ins Amt die Verteidigungsausgaben massiv erhöht – zusätzlich 80 Milliarden US-Dollar für Modernisierung, Luftverteidigung und Hyperschallwaffen. In mehreren Reden betonte er, dass die militärische Überlegenheit der USA „wieder höchste Priorität“ habe. Lockheed Martin ist bereits heute mit über 70 Prozent seines Umsatzes vom US-Militär abhängig – und dürfte damit direkt von den neuen Großaufträgen profitieren. Im Fokus: Neue F-35-Serien Hyperschall-Raketen (Prompt Strike) Raumfahrtprogramme autonome Überwachungs- und Abwehrsysteme Strategischer Trumpf: Technologischer Vorsprung Trumps Regierung will die Abhängigkeit von ausländischer Verteidigungstechnik reduzieren und verstärkt auf nationale Beschaffung setzen. Als führender Anbieter von High-End-Systemen genießt Lockheed Martin hier eine herausragende Position – technologisch, politisch und organisatorisch. Fundamentale Kennzahlen und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 67,6 Mrd. USD 71,0 Mrd. USD 74,3 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 6,9 Mrd. USD 5,3 Mrd.

Die Cashflows gelten als stabil, das Geschäftsmodell als defensiv robust. Anlegerfazit: Sicherheitsaktie mit politischem Rückenwind Lockheed Martin zählt zu den klaren Profiteuren der Trump-Politik. Wer auf berechenbare Regierungsaufträge, politische Priorität und technologische Führungsrolle setzen will, findet hier eine Aktie mit hoher Sichtbarkeit und langfristiger Perspektive. Trump-Faktor: Hoch Risiken: politische Abhängigkeit, internationale Auftragseinbrüche bei Spannungsanstieg Chancen: Milliardenaufträge, technologische Führerschaft, globale Nachfrage nach Sicherheit aktienchart von lockheed martin Lockheed Martin Aktienchart 2021 – 2025 / FinMent 4. Exxon Mobil Aktie: Neue Chancen durch Trumps Energiepolitik Exxon Mobil Corporation (ISIN: US30231G1022 – Symbol: XOM – Währung: USD) Die Exxon Mobil Corporation, mit Hauptsitz in Irving, Texas, ist eines der weltweit führenden Unternehmen in der Öl- und Gasindustrie. Das Unternehmen deckt die gesamte Wertschöpfungskette ab – von der Exploration über die Produktion bis hin zur Raffination und dem Vertrieb von Erdöl und Erdgas. Die Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „XOM“ gehandelt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 453 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) gehört Exxon Mobil zu den Schwergewichten im Energiesektor und hat eine herausragende Position auf dem globalen Markt. Trumps Energieagenda: Förderung statt Verzicht Donald Trump hat nach seiner Amtseinführung einen nationalen Energienotstand ausgerufen und der Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe höchste Priorität eingeräumt. Genehmigungsverfahren wurden vereinfacht, Umweltstandards gelockert und neue Bohrlizenzen im Offshore-Bereich freigegeben. Für Exxon Mobil bedeutet das konkret: Schnellere und günstigere Produktionsfreigaben Neue Infrastrukturprojekte wie Pipelines und Terminals Steuererleichterungen und Subventionen auf Bundesebene Rückzug aus klimapolitischen Verpflichtungen (Pariser Abkommen) Gleichzeitig erhöht sich der politische Druck auf erneuerbare Energien – was die Marktposition klassischer Öl- und Gasunternehmen zusätzlich stärkt. Fundamentale Entwicklung und Perspektive Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 344 Mrd. USD 349 Mrd. USD 340 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 36,0 Mrd. USD 33,7 Mrd. USD 30,5 Mrd. USD KGV (2025e) ca. 14 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 3,8 Trotz schwächerer Ölpreise bleibt Exxon profitabel – auch dank effizienter Kostenstruktur, aggressiver Rückkäufe und wachsender Beteiligung an liquefied natural gas (LNG)-Projekten. Analysten sehen im Umfeld steigender globaler Nachfrage und nationaler Förderung weiteres Kurspotenzial. Anlegerfazit: Fossiler Champion mit politischem Schutzschild Exxon Mobil zählt zu den größten Gewinnern der neuen Energiepolitik in den USA. Der politische Rückenwind verstärkt die operative Stärke des Konzerns und macht ihn zu einem potenziellen Dauerläufer – auch in einem volatilen Marktumfeld. Trump-Faktor: Sehr hoch Risiken: Ölpreisabhängigkeit, geopolitische Spannungen Chancen: Genehmigungsschub, steuerliche Vorteile, Infrastruktur-Boom aktienchart von exxon mobil Exxon Mobil Aktienchart 2021 – 2025 / FinMent 3. Caterpillar Aktie: Infrastruktur-Maschine für Trumps Bauoffensive Caterpillar Inc. (ISIN: US1491231015 – Symbol: CAT – Währung: USD) Caterpillar ist der weltweit führende Hersteller von Baumaschinen, Diesel- und Gasmotoren, Industrieanlagen sowie Minenequipment. Das Unternehmen mit Sitz in Illinois gilt als konjunktursensitiver Schwergewichtsindex im US-Industriesektor – und ist eine Bau- und Infrastruktur-Aktie par excellence, mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 138 Milliarden US-Dollar (Stand: April 2025). Trumps Infrastrukturpolitik: America Builds Again Donald Trump hat bereits in seiner ersten Amtszeit Infrastrukturprojekte als zentrales Element seiner Wirtschaftspolitik propagiert – doch erst 2025 werden die Pläne massiv umgesetzt. Die neue Regierung kündigte ein 1-Billionen-US-Dollar-Programm zur Modernisierung von Straßen, Brücken, Pipelines und Energieinfrastruktur an. Caterpillar profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Staatliche Nachfrage nach Bau- und Erdbewegungsmaschinen Erleichterte Umweltauflagen für Bauprojekte Stärkung nationaler Lieferketten – Vorteil für US-Produktion Steuervorteile für Investitionen in Maschinen & Ausrüstung Fundamentale Entwicklung und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 67,1 Mrd. USD 71,5 Mrd. USD 75,2 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 9,2 Mrd. USD 10,0 Mrd. USD 10,6 Mrd. USD KGV (2025e) ca. 15 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 2,0 % Caterpillar ist nicht nur profitabel, sondern auch cashflow-stark. Die Nachfrage im US-Markt ist robust, die Book-to-Bill-Ratio in den Bereichen Bau & Mining liegt über 1 – ein Zeichen für solides Wachstum. Zusatztreiber: Deglobalisierung & Rohstoffwende Die protektionistische Handelspolitik der Trump-Regierung wirkt indirekt positiv auf Caterpillar. Denn mit steigenden Zöllen auf Maschinenimporte aus Europa und Asien gewinnen US-Produzenten an Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Gleichzeitig befeuert die globale Unsicherheit Investitionen in Energie- und Rohstoffgewinnung – ein weiteres Standbein für Caterpillar. Anlegerfazit: Realwirtschaftlicher Trump-Profiteur mit Substanz Caterpillar ist kein spekulativer Highflyer, sondern ein solider Konjunkturzykliker mit politischem Rückenwind. Wer auf reale Infrastrukturinvestitionen, Cashflows und US-zentriertes Wachstum setzen will, findet hier eine Trump-Aktie mit Substanz.

Die Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „ORCL“ gehandelt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 360 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) spielt Oracle eine zentrale Rolle in der Entwicklung moderner IT-Infrastrukturen. Stargate: 500 Milliarden US-Dollar für Amerikas KI-Zukunft Donald Trump hat unmittelbar nach Amtsantritt ein Investitionsprogramm in Höhe von 500 Milliarden US-Dollar angekündigt, das den Ausbau der nationalen KI-Infrastruktur beschleunigen soll. Oracle ist – neben OpenAI und Softbank – einer der zentralen Technologiepartner. Was das konkret bedeutet: Großaufträge für Rechenzentren und Cloud-Kapazitäten Politische Unterstützung für inländische Datenverarbeitung Wegfall ethischer KI-Regulierung = höhere Innovationsgeschwindigkeit Positionierung als „Sicherheitsanbieter“ im Sinne nationaler Datensouveränität Oracle bringt mit seiner eigenen Cloud-Plattform (OCI – Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) und den weltweit genutzten Datenbanksystemen genau die Fähigkeiten mit, die jetzt politisch gewollt sind: schnell skalierbare Systeme, US-basiert und unter Kontrolle der Regierungspartner. Fundamentale Entwicklung und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 50,0 Mrd. USD 53,0 Mrd. USD 57,0 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 8,5 Mrd. USD 10,5 Mrd.

BONUS: Trump-Watchlist 2025 – Diese Aktien könnten ebenfalls profitieren Nicht alle Trump-Profiteure haben es in die Top 5 geschafft – doch einige spannende Kandidaten verdienen dennoch einen Platz auf Ihrer Watchlist: Tesla (TSLA) Elon Musk steht Trump politisch überraschend nahe. Sollte Tesla von steuerlichen Erleichterungen, Inlandsproduktion und Infrastrukturprojekten profitieren, könnte die Aktie ungeahnt Rückenwind erhalten – auch ohne direkte Beteiligung am Stargate-Programm. Palantir (PLTR) Das Datenanalyse-Unternehmen mit starken Regierungsbeziehungen könnte im Zuge wachsender Sicherheitsausgaben und nationaler IT-Projekte zusätzliche Aufträge gewinnen – besonders im Bereich KI-gestützter Verteidigung. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Als größter US-Finanzkonzern profitiert JPMorgan breit von Trumps Finanzagenda – von M&A-Fantasie bis zur Kreditvergabe in der Infrastruktur. Lennar & D.R. Horton (LEN, DHI) Die beiden US-Baukonzerne könnten stark von Trumps Wohnungsbauoffensive profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten durch Einwanderungsregulierung. Deere & Company (DE) Als Hersteller von Land- und Baumaschinen ist Deere ein direkter Gewinner nationaler Infrastrukturprojekte – und könnte durch Importzölle auf ausländische Maschinen Marktanteile gewinnen. Hinweis: Diese Aktien sind spekulativer als die Top 5 – bieten aber unter Trumps politischer Agenda gezielte Chancen, vor allem im Bereich Technologie, Bau und nationale Sicherheit.","https://finment.com/boerse-aktien/us-aktien/top-donald-trump-aktien/"

Picture of Adrian Schmid Adrian Schmid | Letzte Aktualisierung am 8.04.2025 Mit seinem Zollhammer erschüttert Donald Trump die globale Wirtschaft – und die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit einem historischen Schockmoment. Seit dem 5. April 2025 gelten in den USA flächendeckende Importzölle von mindestens 10 Prozent, für Produkte aus China sogar 34 Prozent – mit der Drohung, diese um weitere 50 Prozent zu erhöhen. Diese Drohung ist bereits einen Tag später eingetreten – 104 Prozent Zölle gegen China! Die Folge? Ein Blutbad an den Börsen: Der Nasdaq stürzt in nur drei Handelstagen um über 16 Prozent ab Der S&P 500 verliert 15 Prozent Der DAX fällt sogar um 17 Prozent Rohstoffe wie WTI-Öl und Silber rauschen um bis zu 21 Prozent nach unten Der VIX explodiert auf über 60 – Angst dominiert die Wall Street Der Fear & Greed Index steht bei 4: Extreme Fear. Die Aktienmärkte stehen unter Schock – und doch: Mitten im Chaos entstehen neue Chancen. Denn während viele Exporteure, Konsumriesen und Big Tech-Aktien unter Druck geraten, profitieren andere direkt von Trumps Agenda. In diesem Artikel analysieren wir die Top 5 Donald Trump Aktien 2025 – Unternehmen, die vom neuen wirtschaftspolitischen Kurs profitieren könnten: durch nationale Investitionen, steuerliche Entlastungen und gezielte Branchenförderung. Welche Aktien könnten jetzt zur neuen Marktelite aufsteigen – und welche Rolle kann der „Trump-Turbo“ in Ihrem Depot spielen? Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt mit einem crash und börsenbeben, wahl sieg Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt / Shutterstock Donald Trumps Zollhammer 2025: So verändert der US-Präsident den Welthandel Was zunächst wie wirtschaftspolitischer Wahnsinn wirkt, folgt einer klaren Logik: US Präsident Donald Trump will die Vereinigten Staaten zur Festung der Produktion machen. Mit dem pauschalen Importzoll von mindestens 10 Prozent auf alle Waren (seit 5. April 2025) beginnt die Umsetzung seiner protektionistischen Vision einer „autarken Supermacht“. Besonders hart trifft es Länder mit hohen Handelsüberschüssen gegenüber den USA – allen voran China, das mit einer Zollbelastung von insgesamt 54 Prozent konfrontiert ist. Doch auch Deutschland, Japan, Kanada, Vietnam und die Schweiz spüren die neue Zollpolitik deutlich. Der US-Präsident hat klargemacht: Wer amerikanische Produkte blockiert oder unterbietet, zahlt den Preis. Was das bedeutet: Zollankündigung EU-Zölle: 20 Prozent Japan: 25 Prozent auf Autos, 24 Prozent auf Konsumgüter Kanada: 25 Prozent auf nicht in den USA hergestellte Autos Schweiz: 31 Prozent China: 34 Prozent + mögliche Aufstockung auf 50 Prozent Für über 40 Länder gelten Sonderzölle zwischen 30 und 50 Prozent – darunter viele asiatische und afrikanische Staaten. Gleichzeitig läuft eine 51-tägige Übergangsfrist, die bis zum 27. Mai 2025 für Waren gilt, die vor dem Stichtag verschifft wurden. Trumps strategisches Ziel: Handelsbilanz verbessern US-Produktion reindustrialisieren Abhängigkeiten von China & Europa verringern Neue Investitionsanreize im Inland schaffen Ergänzt wird der Zollhammer durch gezielte Ausnahmen für „kritische Rohstoffe und Technologien“ wie Halbleiter, Kupfer oder Arzneimittel – doch selbst diese könnten bald unter Trumps nächste Zollrunde fallen. Zwischenfazit: Trump nutzt den Zoll als geopolitisches und wirtschaftliches Werkzeug – nicht nur zur Machtdemonstration, sondern um gezielt Wachstum zurück in die USA zu zwingen. Für global aufgestellte Unternehmen ist das eine Herausforderung – für national fokussierte US-Konzerne eine historische Chance. DAX, Nasdaq & Co im freien Fall – Was jetzt nach dem Trump-Schock zählt Die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit beispielloser Wucht auf Trumps Zolloffensive – der sogenannte „Trump-Schock 2.0“ entfaltet seine volle Wucht. Innerhalb von nur drei Handelstagen erleben Anleger ein Szenario, das selbst krisenerprobte Marktteilnehmer sprachlos macht: Indizes im freien Fall Nasdaq Composite: –16 Prozent S&P 500: –15 Prozent DAX: –17 Prozent Rohstoffe brechen ein WTI-Öl: –18 Prozent Silber: –21 Prozent Panikindikatoren schlagen Alarm Volatilitätsindex VIX: springt auf über 60 Punkte – der zweithöchste Stand seit dem Corona-Crash Fear & Greed Index: fällt auf 4 von 100 – ein klares Signal für Extreme Fear Was wir erleben, ist nicht nur ein Börsenrücksetzer, sondern ein fundamentaler Stimmungsumschwung. Anleger fliehen aus Risikoassets, verkaufen Tech-Giganten und meiden exportorientierte Geschäftsmodelle. Der globale Kapitalstrom kehrt sich um – weg von Internationalisierung, hin zur nationalen Robustheit. Doch mitten im Tumult beginnt das große Umdenken: Denn während Exporteure taumeln, gewinnen andere an Stärke. US-Unternehmen mit starker Inlandsfokussierung, politischer Rückendeckung und direkter Nähe zu Trumps strategischer Agenda rücken plötzlich ins Zentrum des Anlegerinteresses. trump zoll ankündigung, sturm an den aktienmärken, handelskrieg Trump Zollkrieg / Shutterstock Was jetzt zählt: Wer liefert Stabilität im Inland? Wer profitiert von Staatsaufträgen, Deregulierung und Investitionen? Wer kann unter Trump schneller wachsen – weil die Regeln gelockert sind? Der Markt preist nicht nur Angst ein – er beginnt, neue Gewinner zu suchen. Diese Sektoren sind die neuen Gewinner unter Donald Trump – Aktien mit Potenzial Mit Zöllen, Deregulierung und milliardenschweren Investitionen hat Donald Trump die Spielregeln an der Börse neu definiert. Seine Wirtschaftspolitik belohnt nicht Internationalität, sondern strategischen Patriotismus: Wer in den USA produziert, sich auf das Heimatland fokussiert oder Trumps Agenda bedient, hat plötzlich die Nase vorn. Inmitten der Turbulenzen kristallisieren sich fünf Schlüsselbranchen heraus, die nun politisch priorisiert und finanziell begünstigt werden – und damit zu den neuen Hoffnungsträgern der Märkte avancieren könnten: 1. Verteidigung: Sicherheit wird wieder zur Aktienstory Was Trump will: Einen starken militärischen Industriekomplex. Das Verteidigungsbudget wächst um 80 Milliarden US-Dollar. Der Fokus liegt auf nationaler Unabhängigkeit, technologischem Vorsprung und militärischer Dominanz. Was die Märkte sehen: Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman und General Dynamics stehen am Anfang einer neuen Auftragswelle – von Hyperschallwaffen über Luftverteidigung bis zu autonomen Systemen. Analysten erwarten Milliardenaufträge im zweistelligen Bereich. Anlegerfazit: Planbare Umsätze, politische Priorität, hohe Eintrittsbarrieren. Verteidigung ist unter Trump kein Randthema – sie ist ein Investmenttrend. 2. Energie: Fossil wird wieder strategisch Was Trump will: Volle Energieunabhängigkeit. Öl, Gas, Kohle und Uran sollen Amerikas Grundversorgung sichern – nicht Windräder und Solarpanels aus China. Was die Märkte sehen: Exxon Mobil und Chevron profitieren von beschleunigten Genehmigungen, während Uranium Energy durch die Renaissance der Kernkraft neues Potenzial bekommt. Der Rohstoffmarkt dreht – nicht trotz, sondern wegen geopolitischer Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wachstum durch politische Rückendeckung. Trumps Energiepolitik favorisiert Konzerne mit US-Fokus und eigener Produktion. Ein Comeback fossiler Werte zeichnet sich ab. 3. Technologie & KI: Made in USA statt global Was Trump will: Die digitale Vorherrschaft der USA – unabhängig von europäischen Ethikregeln oder chinesischer Hardware. Das Stargate-Programm in Höhe von 500 Milliarden US-Dollar ist Ausdruck dieser Ambition. Was die Märkte sehen: Oracle als direkter Stargate-Partner profitiert ebenso wie Nvidia, Microsoft oder Palantir. Die Abschaffung regulatorischer Schranken könnte zusätzlich die Innovationsgeschwindigkeit erhöhen – wenn auch mit Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wer in KI investiert, investiert in die neue „digitale Infrastruktur Amerikas“. Trump verleiht dem Sektor nicht nur Budget, sondern auch narrative Schlagkraft. 4. Infrastruktur & Bau: Die Betonwende Was Trump will: Bauen, sichern, modernisieren. Straßen, Zäune, Wohnungen. Bauwirtschaft als Wachstumsanker und Jobmaschine. Was die Märkte sehen: Lennar, D.R. Horton und Caterpillar könnten von staatlichen Großprojekten profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten infolge verschärfter Immigration. Maschinenbauer wie Deere rücken ebenfalls in den Fokus. Anlegerfazit: Infrastrukturunternehmen mit US-Präsenz erhalten direkten Zugang zu Staatsaufträgen – ein klassisches Trump-Muster: Innen vor Außen. 5. Finanzen: Deregulierung Reloaded Was Trump will: Kapitalfreisetzung durch Steuererleichterungen, weniger Bürokratie und neue Anreize für M&A-Aktivitäten. Was die Märkte sehen: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan und Blackstone positionieren sich früh. Der M&A-Boom ist realistisch – ebenso wie steigende Margen im Trading und der Vermögensverwaltung. Anlegerfazit: Banken erleben ein Comeback der Deregulierung. Wer auf Transaktionen, Kreditvergabe und Asset Management setzt, könnte im Finanzsektor neue Erträge erschließen. Strategisches Zwischenfazit für Anleger: Die Politik bestimmt die Börsenordnung neu. Und Anleger, die Trumps Agenda frühzeitig verstehen, können gezielt profitieren. Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Verteidigung Aufrüstung, Sicherheit Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman Energie Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe Exxon, Chevron, Uranium Energy Technologie Stargate, KI-Förderung Oracle, Nvidia, Palanti Infrastruktur Bauprojekte, US-Subventionen Caterpillar, Lennar, D.R. Horton Finanzen Deregulierung, Steuern Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone Der Trump-Turbo für Anleger: Alternative Anlageformen wie ETFs Nicht jeder Privatanleger möchte oder kann gezielt einzelne US-Aktien auswählen, die potenziell von Trumps Politik profitieren. Eine interessante Alternative stellt hier ein Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) dar, der eine breite Streuung und Risikominderung ermöglicht. Durch den Kauf eines US-Aktien-ETFs lässt sich das Kapital auf viele amerikanische Unternehmen verteilen, wodurch man das Potenzial des gesamten US-Marktes nutzen und gleichzeitig das Risiko durch Diversifikation minimieren kann. Ein besonders attraktiver ETF für Börsianer, die am US-Markt partizipieren möchten, ist der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF (ISIN: IE00B3XXRP09). Dieser ETF bildet den S&P 500 Index ab, der die 500 größten US-Unternehmen umfasst. So können Investoren breit gestreut in die US-Wirtschaft investieren, ohne auf einzelne Aktien setzen zu müssen. Der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF hat eine Marktkapitalisierung von ca. 34,6 Milliarden USD (Stand 07.04.2025) und legt seinen Schwerpunkt auf die Branchen Technologie (33,5 Prozent), Finanzwesen (11,0 Prozent), Nicht-Basiskonsumgüter (10,8 Prozent), Gesundheitswesen (10,3 Prozent), in denen sich besonders viele Trump-begünstigte Unternehmen befinden könnten. Beispielsweise sind Schwergewichte wie Apple (7,0 Prozent), Microsoft (6,1 Prozent) und NVIDIA (6,6 Prozent) im ETF enthalten, was Anlegern Zugang zu den größten und profitabelsten Unternehmen der USA verschafft. Der ETF überzeugt zudem durch niedrige Gebühren: Die Gesamtkostenquote (Total Expense Ratio, TER) liegt bei nur 0,07 Prozent pro Jahr. Dividenden werden quartalsweise ausgeschüttet, wie zuletzt im März 2025 (0,30 USD je Anteil), was Anlegern einen zusätzlichen Ertrag ermöglicht. Trotz der attraktiven Möglichkeiten, die ein US-Aktien ETF wie der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF bietet, sollten Anleger jedoch darauf achten, nicht ihr gesamtes Kapital ausschließlich in den US-Markt zu investieren. ETFs auf internationale Märkte können helfen, die Volatilität zu reduzieren und das Risiko weiter zu streuen. Weitere ETFs für Ihren Vermögensaufbau finden Sie hier Beste ETFs.

Die Firma ist bekannt für die Entwicklung und Produktion fortschrittlicher Technologien, darunter Kampfflugzeuge, Raketenabwehrsysteme und Satelliten. Die Lockheed Martin Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „LMT“ gehandelt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 101 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) spielt Lockheed Martin eine zentrale Rolle in der globalen Verteidigungsindustrie. luft und raumfahrt: foto von lockheed martin aktie, flugzeug betankt in der luft ein kampfjet f 35, rüstungs aktien, rolls royce Luftbetankung eines Kampfjets / Lockheed Martin Warum Lockheed Martin unter Trump besonders profitiert Donald Trump hat nach seiner Rückkehr ins Amt die Verteidigungsausgaben massiv erhöht – zusätzlich 80 Milliarden US-Dollar für Modernisierung, Luftverteidigung und Hyperschallwaffen. In mehreren Reden betonte er, dass die militärische Überlegenheit der USA „wieder höchste Priorität“ habe. Lockheed Martin ist bereits heute mit über 70 Prozent seines Umsatzes vom US-Militär abhängig – und dürfte damit direkt von den neuen Großaufträgen profitieren. Im Fokus: Neue F-35-Serien Hyperschall-Raketen (Prompt Strike) Raumfahrtprogramme autonome Überwachungs- und Abwehrsysteme Strategischer Trumpf: Technologischer Vorsprung Trumps Regierung will die Abhängigkeit von ausländischer Verteidigungstechnik reduzieren und verstärkt auf nationale Beschaffung setzen. Als führender Anbieter von High-End-Systemen genießt Lockheed Martin hier eine herausragende Position – technologisch, politisch und organisatorisch. Fundamentale Kennzahlen und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 67,6 Mrd. USD 71,0 Mrd. USD 74,3 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 6,9 Mrd. USD 5,3 Mrd.

Die Cashflows gelten als stabil, das Geschäftsmodell als defensiv robust. Anlegerfazit: Sicherheitsaktie mit politischem Rückenwind Lockheed Martin zählt zu den klaren Profiteuren der Trump-Politik. Wer auf berechenbare Regierungsaufträge, politische Priorität und technologische Führungsrolle setzen will, findet hier eine Aktie mit hoher Sichtbarkeit und langfristiger Perspektive. Trump-Faktor: Hoch Risiken: politische Abhängigkeit, internationale Auftragseinbrüche bei Spannungsanstieg Chancen: Milliardenaufträge, technologische Führerschaft, globale Nachfrage nach Sicherheit aktienchart von lockheed martin Lockheed Martin Aktienchart 2021 – 2025 / FinMent 4. Exxon Mobil Aktie: Neue Chancen durch Trumps Energiepolitik Exxon Mobil Corporation (ISIN: US30231G1022 – Symbol: XOM – Währung: USD) Die Exxon Mobil Corporation, mit Hauptsitz in Irving, Texas, ist eines der weltweit führenden Unternehmen in der Öl- und Gasindustrie. Das Unternehmen deckt die gesamte Wertschöpfungskette ab – von der Exploration über die Produktion bis hin zur Raffination und dem Vertrieb von Erdöl und Erdgas. Die Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „XOM“ gehandelt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 453 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) gehört Exxon Mobil zu den Schwergewichten im Energiesektor und hat eine herausragende Position auf dem globalen Markt. Trumps Energieagenda: Förderung statt Verzicht Donald Trump hat nach seiner Amtseinführung einen nationalen Energienotstand ausgerufen und der Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe höchste Priorität eingeräumt. Genehmigungsverfahren wurden vereinfacht, Umweltstandards gelockert und neue Bohrlizenzen im Offshore-Bereich freigegeben. Für Exxon Mobil bedeutet das konkret: Schnellere und günstigere Produktionsfreigaben Neue Infrastrukturprojekte wie Pipelines und Terminals Steuererleichterungen und Subventionen auf Bundesebene Rückzug aus klimapolitischen Verpflichtungen (Pariser Abkommen) Gleichzeitig erhöht sich der politische Druck auf erneuerbare Energien – was die Marktposition klassischer Öl- und Gasunternehmen zusätzlich stärkt. Fundamentale Entwicklung und Perspektive Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 344 Mrd. USD 349 Mrd. USD 340 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 36,0 Mrd. USD 33,7 Mrd. USD 30,5 Mrd. USD KGV (2025e) ca. 14 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 3,8 Trotz schwächerer Ölpreise bleibt Exxon profitabel – auch dank effizienter Kostenstruktur, aggressiver Rückkäufe und wachsender Beteiligung an liquefied natural gas (LNG)-Projekten. Analysten sehen im Umfeld steigender globaler Nachfrage und nationaler Förderung weiteres Kurspotenzial. Anlegerfazit: Fossiler Champion mit politischem Schutzschild Exxon Mobil zählt zu den größten Gewinnern der neuen Energiepolitik in den USA. Der politische Rückenwind verstärkt die operative Stärke des Konzerns und macht ihn zu einem potenziellen Dauerläufer – auch in einem volatilen Marktumfeld. Trump-Faktor: Sehr hoch Risiken: Ölpreisabhängigkeit, geopolitische Spannungen Chancen: Genehmigungsschub, steuerliche Vorteile, Infrastruktur-Boom aktienchart von exxon mobil Exxon Mobil Aktienchart 2021 – 2025 / FinMent 3. Caterpillar Aktie: Infrastruktur-Maschine für Trumps Bauoffensive Caterpillar Inc. (ISIN: US1491231015 – Symbol: CAT – Währung: USD) Caterpillar ist der weltweit führende Hersteller von Baumaschinen, Diesel- und Gasmotoren, Industrieanlagen sowie Minenequipment. Das Unternehmen mit Sitz in Illinois gilt als konjunktursensitiver Schwergewichtsindex im US-Industriesektor – und ist eine Bau- und Infrastruktur-Aktie par excellence, mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 138 Milliarden US-Dollar (Stand: April 2025). Trumps Infrastrukturpolitik: America Builds Again Donald Trump hat bereits in seiner ersten Amtszeit Infrastrukturprojekte als zentrales Element seiner Wirtschaftspolitik propagiert – doch erst 2025 werden die Pläne massiv umgesetzt. Die neue Regierung kündigte ein 1-Billionen-US-Dollar-Programm zur Modernisierung von Straßen, Brücken, Pipelines und Energieinfrastruktur an. Caterpillar profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Staatliche Nachfrage nach Bau- und Erdbewegungsmaschinen Erleichterte Umweltauflagen für Bauprojekte Stärkung nationaler Lieferketten – Vorteil für US-Produktion Steuervorteile für Investitionen in Maschinen & Ausrüstung Fundamentale Entwicklung und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 67,1 Mrd. USD 71,5 Mrd. USD 75,2 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 9,2 Mrd. USD 10,0 Mrd. USD 10,6 Mrd. USD KGV (2025e) ca. 15 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 2,0 % Caterpillar ist nicht nur profitabel, sondern auch cashflow-stark. Die Nachfrage im US-Markt ist robust, die Book-to-Bill-Ratio in den Bereichen Bau & Mining liegt über 1 – ein Zeichen für solides Wachstum. Zusatztreiber: Deglobalisierung & Rohstoffwende Die protektionistische Handelspolitik der Trump-Regierung wirkt indirekt positiv auf Caterpillar. Denn mit steigenden Zöllen auf Maschinenimporte aus Europa und Asien gewinnen US-Produzenten an Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Gleichzeitig befeuert die globale Unsicherheit Investitionen in Energie- und Rohstoffgewinnung – ein weiteres Standbein für Caterpillar. Anlegerfazit: Realwirtschaftlicher Trump-Profiteur mit Substanz Caterpillar ist kein spekulativer Highflyer, sondern ein solider Konjunkturzykliker mit politischem Rückenwind. Wer auf reale Infrastrukturinvestitionen, Cashflows und US-zentriertes Wachstum setzen will, findet hier eine Trump-Aktie mit Substanz. Trump-Faktor: Hoch Risiken: Zinssensitivität, Projektverzögerungen Chancen: Staatsaufträge, Investitionsdynamik, Subventionsvorteile Caterpillar Aktienchart 2021 – 2025 / FinMent 2.

Die Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „ORCL“ gehandelt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 360 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) spielt Oracle eine zentrale Rolle in der Entwicklung moderner IT-Infrastrukturen. Stargate: 500 Milliarden US-Dollar für Amerikas KI-Zukunft Donald Trump hat unmittelbar nach Amtsantritt ein Investitionsprogramm in Höhe von 500 Milliarden US-Dollar angekündigt, das den Ausbau der nationalen KI-Infrastruktur beschleunigen soll. Oracle ist – neben OpenAI und Softbank – einer der zentralen Technologiepartner. Was das konkret bedeutet: Großaufträge für Rechenzentren und Cloud-Kapazitäten Politische Unterstützung für inländische Datenverarbeitung Wegfall ethischer KI-Regulierung = höhere Innovationsgeschwindigkeit Positionierung als „Sicherheitsanbieter“ im Sinne nationaler Datensouveränität Oracle bringt mit seiner eigenen Cloud-Plattform (OCI – Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) und den weltweit genutzten Datenbanksystemen genau die Fähigkeiten mit, die jetzt politisch gewollt sind: schnell skalierbare Systeme, US-basiert und unter Kontrolle der Regierungspartner. Fundamentale Entwicklung und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 50,0 Mrd. USD 53,0 Mrd. USD 57,0 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 8,5 Mrd. USD 10,5 Mrd.

Trump-Effekt: Deregulierung & M&A-Boom Donald Trump verfolgt einen wirtschaftsfreundlichen Kurs mit dem Ziel, die Finanzmärkte zu „entfesseln“. Regulatorische Auflagen aus der Dodd-Frank-Ära werden gelockert oder gestrichen, Kapitalvorgaben gelockert und steuerliche Anreize für Fusionen und Übernahmen geschaffen. Goldman profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Mehr Spielraum für profitable Eigenhandelsgeschäfte Neue Impulse im M&A-Geschäft – vor allem bei US-Konzernen Wachstum im Asset Management durch steuerbegünstigte Anlagevehikel Repatriierung von Kapital – stärkere US-Fokus-Strategien Die Bank hat bereits signalisiert, ihre M&A-Kapazitäten 2025 auszubauen und erwartet eine Zunahme von IPOs sowie Restrukturierungen in Industrie, Tech und Healthcare.

BONUS: Trump-Watchlist 2025 – Diese Aktien könnten ebenfalls profitieren Nicht alle Trump-Profiteure haben es in die Top 5 geschafft – doch einige spannende Kandidaten verdienen dennoch einen Platz auf Ihrer Watchlist: Tesla (TSLA) Elon Musk steht Trump politisch überraschend nahe. Sollte Tesla von steuerlichen Erleichterungen, Inlandsproduktion und Infrastrukturprojekten profitieren, könnte die Aktie ungeahnt Rückenwind erhalten – auch ohne direkte Beteiligung am Stargate-Programm. Palantir (PLTR) Das Datenanalyse-Unternehmen mit starken Regierungsbeziehungen könnte im Zuge wachsender Sicherheitsausgaben und nationaler IT-Projekte zusätzliche Aufträge gewinnen – besonders im Bereich KI-gestützter Verteidigung. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Als größter US-Finanzkonzern profitiert JPMorgan breit von Trumps Finanzagenda – von M&A-Fantasie bis zur Kreditvergabe in der Infrastruktur. Lennar & D.R. Horton (LEN, DHI) Die beiden US-Baukonzerne könnten stark von Trumps Wohnungsbauoffensive profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten durch Einwanderungsregulierung. Deere & Company (DE) Als Hersteller von Land- und Baumaschinen ist Deere ein direkter Gewinner nationaler Infrastrukturprojekte – und könnte durch Importzölle auf ausländische Maschinen Marktanteile gewinnen. Hinweis: Diese Aktien sind spekulativer als die Top 5 – bieten aber unter Trumps politischer Agenda gezielte Chancen, vor allem im Bereich Technologie, Bau und nationale Sicherheit.","https://finment.com/boerse-aktien/us-aktien/top-donald-trump-aktien/"

Picture of Adrian Schmid Adrian Schmid | Letzte Aktualisierung am 8.04.2025 Mit seinem Zollhammer erschüttert Donald Trump die globale Wirtschaft – und die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit einem historischen Schockmoment. Seit dem 5. April 2025 gelten in den USA flächendeckende Importzölle von mindestens 10 Prozent, für Produkte aus China sogar 34 Prozent – mit der Drohung, diese um weitere 50 Prozent zu erhöhen. Diese Drohung ist bereits einen Tag später eingetreten – 104 Prozent Zölle gegen China! Die Folge? Ein Blutbad an den Börsen: Der Nasdaq stürzt in nur drei Handelstagen um über 16 Prozent ab Der S&P 500 verliert 15 Prozent Der DAX fällt sogar um 17 Prozent Rohstoffe wie WTI-Öl und Silber rauschen um bis zu 21 Prozent nach unten Der VIX explodiert auf über 60 – Angst dominiert die Wall Street Der Fear & Greed Index steht bei 4: Extreme Fear. Die Aktienmärkte stehen unter Schock – und doch: Mitten im Chaos entstehen neue Chancen. Denn während viele Exporteure, Konsumriesen und Big Tech-Aktien unter Druck geraten, profitieren andere direkt von Trumps Agenda. In diesem Artikel analysieren wir die Top 5 Donald Trump Aktien 2025 – Unternehmen, die vom neuen wirtschaftspolitischen Kurs profitieren könnten: durch nationale Investitionen, steuerliche Entlastungen und gezielte Branchenförderung. Welche Aktien könnten jetzt zur neuen Marktelite aufsteigen – und welche Rolle kann der „Trump-Turbo“ in Ihrem Depot spielen? Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt mit einem crash und börsenbeben, wahl sieg Donald Trump ist offiziell wieder im Amt / Shutterstock Donald Trumps Zollhammer 2025: So verändert der US-Präsident den Welthandel Was zunächst wie wirtschaftspolitischer Wahnsinn wirkt, folgt einer klaren Logik: US Präsident Donald Trump will die Vereinigten Staaten zur Festung der Produktion machen. Mit dem pauschalen Importzoll von mindestens 10 Prozent auf alle Waren (seit 5. April 2025) beginnt die Umsetzung seiner protektionistischen Vision einer „autarken Supermacht“. Besonders hart trifft es Länder mit hohen Handelsüberschüssen gegenüber den USA – allen voran China, das mit einer Zollbelastung von insgesamt 54 Prozent konfrontiert ist. Doch auch Deutschland, Japan, Kanada, Vietnam und die Schweiz spüren die neue Zollpolitik deutlich. Der US-Präsident hat klargemacht: Wer amerikanische Produkte blockiert oder unterbietet, zahlt den Preis. Was das bedeutet: Zollankündigung EU-Zölle: 20 Prozent Japan: 25 Prozent auf Autos, 24 Prozent auf Konsumgüter Kanada: 25 Prozent auf nicht in den USA hergestellte Autos Schweiz: 31 Prozent China: 34 Prozent + mögliche Aufstockung auf 50 Prozent Für über 40 Länder gelten Sonderzölle zwischen 30 und 50 Prozent – darunter viele asiatische und afrikanische Staaten. Gleichzeitig läuft eine 51-tägige Übergangsfrist, die bis zum 27. Mai 2025 für Waren gilt, die vor dem Stichtag verschifft wurden. Trumps strategisches Ziel: Handelsbilanz verbessern US-Produktion reindustrialisieren Abhängigkeiten von China & Europa verringern Neue Investitionsanreize im Inland schaffen Ergänzt wird der Zollhammer durch gezielte Ausnahmen für „kritische Rohstoffe und Technologien“ wie Halbleiter, Kupfer oder Arzneimittel – doch selbst diese könnten bald unter Trumps nächste Zollrunde fallen. Zwischenfazit: Trump nutzt den Zoll als geopolitisches und wirtschaftliches Werkzeug – nicht nur zur Machtdemonstration, sondern um gezielt Wachstum zurück in die USA zu zwingen. Für global aufgestellte Unternehmen ist das eine Herausforderung – für national fokussierte US-Konzerne eine historische Chance. DAX, Nasdaq & Co im freien Fall – Was jetzt nach dem Trump-Schock zählt Die Finanzmärkte reagieren mit beispielloser Wucht auf Trumps Zolloffensive – der sogenannte „Trump-Schock 2.0“ entfaltet seine volle Wucht. Innerhalb von nur drei Handelstagen erleben Anleger ein Szenario, das selbst krisenerprobte Marktteilnehmer sprachlos macht: Indizes im freien Fall Nasdaq Composite: –16 Prozent S&P 500: –15 Prozent DAX: –17 Prozent Rohstoffe brechen ein WTI-Öl: –18 Prozent Silber: –21 Prozent Panikindikatoren schlagen Alarm Volatilitätsindex VIX: springt auf über 60 Punkte – der zweithöchste Stand seit dem Corona-Crash Fear & Greed Index: fällt auf 4 von 100 – ein klares Signal für Extreme Fear Was wir erleben, ist nicht nur ein Börsenrücksetzer, sondern ein fundamentaler Stimmungsumschwung. Anleger fliehen aus Risikoassets, verkaufen Tech-Giganten und meiden exportorientierte Geschäftsmodelle. Der globale Kapitalstrom kehrt sich um – weg von Internationalisierung, hin zur nationalen Robustheit. Doch mitten im Tumult beginnt das große Umdenken: Denn während Exporteure taumeln, gewinnen andere an Stärke. US-Unternehmen mit starker Inlandsfokussierung, politischer Rückendeckung und direkter Nähe zu Trumps strategischer Agenda rücken plötzlich ins Zentrum des Anlegerinteresses. trump zoll ankündigung, sturm an den aktienmärken, handelskrieg Trump Zollkrieg / Shutterstock Was jetzt zählt: Wer liefert Stabilität im Inland? Wer profitiert von Staatsaufträgen, Deregulierung und Investitionen? Wer kann unter Trump schneller wachsen – weil die Regeln gelockert sind? Der Markt preist nicht nur Angst ein – er beginnt, neue Gewinner zu suchen. Diese Sektoren sind die neuen Gewinner unter Donald Trump – Aktien mit Potenzial Mit Zöllen, Deregulierung und milliardenschweren Investitionen hat Donald Trump die Spielregeln an der Börse neu definiert. Seine Wirtschaftspolitik belohnt nicht Internationalität, sondern strategischen Patriotismus: Wer in den USA produziert, sich auf das Heimatland fokussiert oder Trumps Agenda bedient, hat plötzlich die Nase vorn. Inmitten der Turbulenzen kristallisieren sich fünf Schlüsselbranchen heraus, die nun politisch priorisiert und finanziell begünstigt werden – und damit zu den neuen Hoffnungsträgern der Märkte avancieren könnten: 1. Verteidigung: Sicherheit wird wieder zur Aktienstory Was Trump will: Einen starken militärischen Industriekomplex. Das Verteidigungsbudget wächst um 80 Milliarden US-Dollar. Der Fokus liegt auf nationaler Unabhängigkeit, technologischem Vorsprung und militärischer Dominanz. Was die Märkte sehen: Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman und General Dynamics stehen am Anfang einer neuen Auftragswelle – von Hyperschallwaffen über Luftverteidigung bis zu autonomen Systemen. Analysten erwarten Milliardenaufträge im zweistelligen Bereich. Anlegerfazit: Planbare Umsätze, politische Priorität, hohe Eintrittsbarrieren. Verteidigung ist unter Trump kein Randthema – sie ist ein Investmenttrend. 2. Energie: Fossil wird wieder strategisch Was Trump will: Volle Energieunabhängigkeit. Öl, Gas, Kohle und Uran sollen Amerikas Grundversorgung sichern – nicht Windräder und Solarpanels aus China. Was die Märkte sehen: Exxon Mobil und Chevron profitieren von beschleunigten Genehmigungen, während Uranium Energy durch die Renaissance der Kernkraft neues Potenzial bekommt. Der Rohstoffmarkt dreht – nicht trotz, sondern wegen geopolitischer Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wachstum durch politische Rückendeckung. Trumps Energiepolitik favorisiert Konzerne mit US-Fokus und eigener Produktion. Ein Comeback fossiler Werte zeichnet sich ab. 3. Technologie & KI: Made in USA statt global Was Trump will: Die digitale Vorherrschaft der USA – unabhängig von europäischen Ethikregeln oder chinesischer Hardware. Das Stargate-Programm in Höhe von 500 Milliarden US-Dollar ist Ausdruck dieser Ambition. Was die Märkte sehen: Oracle als direkter Stargate-Partner profitiert ebenso wie Nvidia, Microsoft oder Palantir. Die Abschaffung regulatorischer Schranken könnte zusätzlich die Innovationsgeschwindigkeit erhöhen – wenn auch mit Risiken. Anlegerfazit: Wer in KI investiert, investiert in die neue „digitale Infrastruktur Amerikas“. Trump verleiht dem Sektor nicht nur Budget, sondern auch narrative Schlagkraft. 4. Infrastruktur & Bau: Die Betonwende Was Trump will: Bauen, sichern, modernisieren. Straßen, Zäune, Wohnungen. Bauwirtschaft als Wachstumsanker und Jobmaschine. Was die Märkte sehen: Lennar, D.R. Horton und Caterpillar könnten von staatlichen Großprojekten profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten infolge verschärfter Immigration. Maschinenbauer wie Deere rücken ebenfalls in den Fokus. Anlegerfazit: Infrastrukturunternehmen mit US-Präsenz erhalten direkten Zugang zu Staatsaufträgen – ein klassisches Trump-Muster: Innen vor Außen. 5. Finanzen: Deregulierung Reloaded Was Trump will: Kapitalfreisetzung durch Steuererleichterungen, weniger Bürokratie und neue Anreize für M&A-Aktivitäten. Was die Märkte sehen: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan und Blackstone positionieren sich früh. Der M&A-Boom ist realistisch – ebenso wie steigende Margen im Trading und der Vermögensverwaltung. Anlegerfazit: Banken erleben ein Comeback der Deregulierung. Wer auf Transaktionen, Kreditvergabe und Asset Management setzt, könnte im Finanzsektor neue Erträge erschließen. Strategisches Zwischenfazit für Anleger: Die Politik bestimmt die Börsenordnung neu. Und Anleger, die Trumps Agenda frühzeitig verstehen, können gezielt profitieren. Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Sektor Treiber Potenzielle Gewinner Verteidigung Aufrüstung, Sicherheit Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman Energie Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe Exxon, Chevron, Uranium Energy Technologie Stargate, KI-Förderung Oracle, Nvidia, Palanti Infrastruktur Bauprojekte, US-Subventionen Caterpillar, Lennar, D.R. Horton Finanzen Deregulierung, Steuern Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone Der Trump-Turbo für Anleger: Alternative Anlageformen wie ETFs Nicht jeder Privatanleger möchte oder kann gezielt einzelne US-Aktien auswählen, die potenziell von Trumps Politik profitieren. Eine interessante Alternative stellt hier ein Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) dar, der eine breite Streuung und Risikominderung ermöglicht. Durch den Kauf eines US-Aktien-ETFs lässt sich das Kapital auf viele amerikanische Unternehmen verteilen, wodurch man das Potenzial des gesamten US-Marktes nutzen und gleichzeitig das Risiko durch Diversifikation minimieren kann. Ein besonders attraktiver ETF für Börsianer, die am US-Markt partizipieren möchten, ist der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF (ISIN: IE00B3XXRP09). Dieser ETF bildet den S&P 500 Index ab, der die 500 größten US-Unternehmen umfasst. So können Investoren breit gestreut in die US-Wirtschaft investieren, ohne auf einzelne Aktien setzen zu müssen. Der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF hat eine Marktkapitalisierung von ca. 34,6 Milliarden USD (Stand 07.04.2025) und legt seinen Schwerpunkt auf die Branchen Technologie (33,5 Prozent), Finanzwesen (11,0 Prozent), Nicht-Basiskonsumgüter (10,8 Prozent), Gesundheitswesen (10,3 Prozent), in denen sich besonders viele Trump-begünstigte Unternehmen befinden könnten. Beispielsweise sind Schwergewichte wie Apple (7,0 Prozent), Microsoft (6,1 Prozent) und NVIDIA (6,6 Prozent) im ETF enthalten, was Anlegern Zugang zu den größten und profitabelsten Unternehmen der USA verschafft. Der ETF überzeugt zudem durch niedrige Gebühren: Die Gesamtkostenquote (Total Expense Ratio, TER) liegt bei nur 0,07 Prozent pro Jahr. Dividenden werden quartalsweise ausgeschüttet, wie zuletzt im März 2025 (0,30 USD je Anteil), was Anlegern einen zusätzlichen Ertrag ermöglicht. Trotz der attraktiven Möglichkeiten, die ein US-Aktien ETF wie der Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF bietet, sollten Anleger jedoch darauf achten, nicht ihr gesamtes Kapital ausschließlich in den US-Markt zu investieren. ETFs auf internationale Märkte können helfen, die Volatilität zu reduzieren und das Risiko weiter zu streuen. Weitere ETFs für Ihren Vermögensaufbau finden Sie hier Beste ETFs.

Die Firma ist bekannt für die Entwicklung und Produktion fortschrittlicher Technologien, darunter Kampfflugzeuge, Raketenabwehrsysteme und Satelliten.

Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 101 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) spielt Lockheed Martin eine zentrale Rolle in der globalen Verteidigungsindustrie. luft und raumfahrt: foto von lockheed martin aktie, flugzeug betankt in der luft ein kampfjet f 35, rüstungs aktien, rolls royce Luftbetankung eines Kampfjets / Lockheed Martin Warum Lockheed Martin unter Trump besonders profitiert Donald Trump hat nach seiner Rückkehr ins Amt die Verteidigungsausgaben massiv erhöht – zusätzlich 80 Milliarden US-Dollar für Modernisierung, Luftverteidigung und Hyperschallwaffen. In mehreren Reden betonte er, dass die militärische Überlegenheit der USA „wieder höchste Priorität“ habe. Lockheed Martin ist bereits heute mit über 70 Prozent seines Umsatzes vom US-Militär abhängig – und dürfte damit direkt von den neuen Großaufträgen profitieren. Im Fokus: Neue F-35-Serien Hyperschall-Raketen (Prompt Strike) Raumfahrtprogramme autonome Überwachungs- und Abwehrsysteme Strategischer Trumpf: Technologischer Vorsprung Trumps Regierung will die Abhängigkeit von ausländischer Verteidigungstechnik reduzieren und verstärkt auf nationale Beschaffung setzen. Als führender Anbieter von High-End-Systemen genießt Lockheed Martin hier eine herausragende Position – technologisch, politisch und organisatorisch. Fundamentale Kennzahlen und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 67,6 Mrd. USD 71,0 Mrd. USD 74,3 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 6,9 Mrd. USD 5,3 Mrd. USD 6,3 Mrd. USD KGV (2025e) ca. 16 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 3,1 % Analysten sehen weiteres Kurspotenzial, insbesondere wenn Trumps Pläne für Hyperschallwaffen und unbemannte Systeme zügig umgesetzt werden. Die Cashflows gelten als stabil, das Geschäftsmodell als defensiv robust. Anlegerfazit: Sicherheitsaktie mit politischem Rückenwind Lockheed Martin zählt zu den klaren Profiteuren der Trump-Politik. Wer auf berechenbare Regierungsaufträge, politische Priorität und technologische Führungsrolle setzen will, findet hier eine Aktie mit hoher Sichtbarkeit und langfristiger Perspektive. Trump-Faktor: Hoch Risiken: politische Abhängigkeit, internationale Auftragseinbrüche bei Spannungsanstieg Chancen: Milliardenaufträge, technologische Führerschaft, globale Nachfrage nach Sicherheit aktienchart von lockheed martin Lockheed Martin Aktienchart 2021 – 2025 / FinMent 4. Exxon Mobil Aktie: Neue Chancen durch Trumps Energiepolitik Exxon Mobil Corporation (ISIN: US30231G1022 – Symbol: XOM – Währung: USD) Die Exxon Mobil Corporation, mit Hauptsitz in Irving, Texas, ist eines der weltweit führenden Unternehmen in der Öl- und Gasindustrie. Das Unternehmen deckt die gesamte Wertschöpfungskette ab – von der Exploration über die Produktion bis hin zur Raffination und dem Vertrieb von Erdöl und Erdgas. Die Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „XOM“ gehandelt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 453 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) gehört Exxon Mobil zu den Schwergewichten im Energiesektor und hat eine herausragende Position auf dem globalen Markt. Trumps Energieagenda: Förderung statt Verzicht Donald Trump hat nach seiner Amtseinführung einen nationalen Energienotstand ausgerufen und der Förderung fossiler Brennstoffe höchste Priorität eingeräumt. Genehmigungsverfahren wurden vereinfacht, Umweltstandards gelockert und neue Bohrlizenzen im Offshore-Bereich freigegeben. Für Exxon Mobil bedeutet das konkret: Schnellere und günstigere Produktionsfreigaben Neue Infrastrukturprojekte wie Pipelines und Terminals Steuererleichterungen und Subventionen auf Bundesebene Rückzug aus klimapolitischen Verpflichtungen (Pariser Abkommen) Gleichzeitig erhöht sich der politische Druck auf erneuerbare Energien – was die Marktposition klassischer Öl- und Gasunternehmen zusätzlich stärkt. Fundamentale Entwicklung und Perspektive Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 344 Mrd. USD 349 Mrd. USD 340 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 36,0 Mrd. USD 33,7 Mrd. USD 30,5 Mrd. USD KGV (2025e) ca. 14 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 3,8 Trotz schwächerer Ölpreise bleibt Exxon profitabel – auch dank effizienter Kostenstruktur, aggressiver Rückkäufe und wachsender Beteiligung an liquefied natural gas (LNG)-Projekten. Analysten sehen im Umfeld steigender globaler Nachfrage und nationaler Förderung weiteres Kurspotenzial. Anlegerfazit: Fossiler Champion mit politischem Schutzschild Exxon Mobil zählt zu den größten Gewinnern der neuen Energiepolitik in den USA. Der politische Rückenwind verstärkt die operative Stärke des Konzerns und macht ihn zu einem potenziellen Dauerläufer – auch in einem volatilen Marktumfeld. Trump-Faktor: Sehr hoch Risiken: Ölpreisabhängigkeit, geopolitische Spannungen Chancen: Genehmigungsschub, steuerliche Vorteile, Infrastruktur-Boom aktienchart von exxon mobil Exxon Mobil Aktienchart 2021 – 2025 / FinMent 3. Caterpillar Aktie: Infrastruktur-Maschine für Trumps Bauoffensive Caterpillar Inc. (ISIN: US1491231015 – Symbol: CAT – Währung: USD) Caterpillar ist der weltweit führende Hersteller von Baumaschinen, Diesel- und Gasmotoren, Industrieanlagen sowie Minenequipment. Das Unternehmen mit Sitz in Illinois gilt als konjunktursensitiver Schwergewichtsindex im US-Industriesektor – und ist eine Bau- und Infrastruktur-Aktie par excellence, mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 138 Milliarden US-Dollar (Stand: April 2025). Trumps Infrastrukturpolitik: America Builds Again Donald Trump hat bereits in seiner ersten Amtszeit Infrastrukturprojekte als zentrales Element seiner Wirtschaftspolitik propagiert – doch erst 2025 werden die Pläne massiv umgesetzt. Die neue Regierung kündigte ein 1-Billionen-US-Dollar-Programm zur Modernisierung von Straßen, Brücken, Pipelines und Energieinfrastruktur an. Caterpillar profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Staatliche Nachfrage nach Bau- und Erdbewegungsmaschinen Erleichterte Umweltauflagen für Bauprojekte Stärkung nationaler Lieferketten – Vorteil für US-Produktion Steuervorteile für Investitionen in Maschinen & Ausrüstung Fundamentale Entwicklung und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 67,1 Mrd. USD 71,5 Mrd. USD 75,2 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 9,2 Mrd. USD 10,0 Mrd. USD 10,6 Mrd. USD KGV (2025e) ca. 15 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 2,0 % Caterpillar ist nicht nur profitabel, sondern auch cashflow-stark. Die Nachfrage im US-Markt ist robust, die Book-to-Bill-Ratio in den Bereichen Bau & Mining liegt über 1 – ein Zeichen für solides Wachstum. Zusatztreiber: Deglobalisierung & Rohstoffwende Die protektionistische Handelspolitik der Trump-Regierung wirkt indirekt positiv auf Caterpillar. Denn mit steigenden Zöllen auf Maschinenimporte aus Europa und Asien gewinnen US-Produzenten an Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Gleichzeitig befeuert die globale Unsicherheit Investitionen in Energie- und Rohstoffgewinnung – ein weiteres Standbein für Caterpillar. Anlegerfazit: Realwirtschaftlicher Trump-Profiteur mit Substanz Caterpillar ist kein spekulativer Highflyer, sondern ein solider Konjunkturzykliker mit politischem Rückenwind. Wer auf reale Infrastrukturinvestitionen, Cashflows und US-zentriertes Wachstum setzen will, findet hier eine Trump-Aktie mit Substanz. Trump-Faktor: Hoch Risiken: Zinssensitivität, Projektverzögerungen Chancen: Staatsaufträge, Investitionsdynamik, Subventionsvorteile Caterpillar Aktienchart 2021 – 2025 / FinMent 2.

Die Aktie wird an der New York Stock Exchange unter dem Ticker-Symbol „ORCL“ gehandelt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 360 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) spielt Oracle eine zentrale Rolle in der Entwicklung moderner IT-Infrastrukturen. Stargate: 500 Milliarden US-Dollar für Amerikas KI-Zukunft Donald Trump hat unmittelbar nach Amtsantritt ein Investitionsprogramm in Höhe von 500 Milliarden US-Dollar angekündigt, das den Ausbau der nationalen KI-Infrastruktur beschleunigen soll. Oracle ist – neben OpenAI und Softbank – einer der zentralen Technologiepartner. Was das konkret bedeutet: Großaufträge für Rechenzentren und Cloud-Kapazitäten Politische Unterstützung für inländische Datenverarbeitung Wegfall ethischer KI-Regulierung = höhere Innovationsgeschwindigkeit Positionierung als „Sicherheitsanbieter“ im Sinne nationaler Datensouveränität Oracle bringt mit seiner eigenen Cloud-Plattform (OCI – Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) und den weltweit genutzten Datenbanksystemen genau die Fähigkeiten mit, die jetzt politisch gewollt sind: schnell skalierbare Systeme, US-basiert und unter Kontrolle der Regierungspartner. Fundamentale Entwicklung und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 50,0 Mrd. USD 53,0 Mrd. USD 57,0 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 8,5 Mrd. USD 10,5 Mrd.

Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von etwa 153 Milliarden USD (Stand: April 2025) spielt Goldman Sachs eine zentrale Rolle im globalen Finanzsektor. Trump-Effekt: Deregulierung & M&A-Boom Donald Trump verfolgt einen wirtschaftsfreundlichen Kurs mit dem Ziel, die Finanzmärkte zu „entfesseln“. Regulatorische Auflagen aus der Dodd-Frank-Ära werden gelockert oder gestrichen, Kapitalvorgaben gelockert und steuerliche Anreize für Fusionen und Übernahmen geschaffen. Goldman profitiert auf mehreren Ebenen: Mehr Spielraum für profitable Eigenhandelsgeschäfte Neue Impulse im M&A-Geschäft – vor allem bei US-Konzernen Wachstum im Asset Management durch steuerbegünstigte Anlagevehikel Repatriierung von Kapital – stärkere US-Fokus-Strategien Die Bank hat bereits signalisiert, ihre M&A-Kapazitäten 2025 auszubauen und erwartet eine Zunahme von IPOs sowie Restrukturierungen in Industrie, Tech und Healthcare. Fundamentale Entwicklung und Prognosen (Stand April 2025) Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Kennzahl 2023 2024 2025e Umsatz 46,5 Mrd. USD 53,5 Mrd. USD 56,4 Mrd. USD Nettogewinn 7,9 Mrd. USD 13,5 Mrd. USD 14,6 Mrd. USD KGV (2025e) ca. 10 Dividenden Rendite: ca. 2,6 % Der Gewinnsprung 2024 wurde durch starke Ergebnisse im Investmentbanking und Handel erzielt.

Anlegerfazit: Profiteur der Freiheit – und der Transaktionen Goldman Sachs zählt zu den wirtschaftspolitischen Hauptprofiteuren der Trump-Administration. Die Mischung aus politischem Rückenwind, strukturellem Wachstumsfeld (M&A, Private Equity) und starker Profitabilität macht die Aktie zu einem strategischen Trump-Investment im Finanzsektor.

BONUS: Trump-Watchlist 2025 – Diese Aktien könnten ebenfalls profitieren Nicht alle Trump-Profiteure haben es in die Top 5 geschafft – doch einige spannende Kandidaten verdienen dennoch einen Platz auf Ihrer Watchlist: Tesla (TSLA) Elon Musk steht Trump politisch überraschend nahe. Sollte Tesla von steuerlichen Erleichterungen, Inlandsproduktion und Infrastrukturprojekten profitieren, könnte die Aktie ungeahnt Rückenwind erhalten – auch ohne direkte Beteiligung am Stargate-Programm. Palantir (PLTR) Das Datenanalyse-Unternehmen mit starken Regierungsbeziehungen könnte im Zuge wachsender Sicherheitsausgaben und nationaler IT-Projekte zusätzliche Aufträge gewinnen – besonders im Bereich KI-gestützter Verteidigung. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Als größter US-Finanzkonzern profitiert JPMorgan breit von Trumps Finanzagenda – von M&A-Fantasie bis zur Kreditvergabe in der Infrastruktur. Lennar & D.R. Horton (LEN, DHI) Die beiden US-Baukonzerne könnten stark von Trumps Wohnungsbauoffensive profitieren – trotz höherer Lohnkosten durch Einwanderungsregulierung. Deere & Company (DE) Als Hersteller von Land- und Baumaschinen ist Deere ein direkter Gewinner nationaler Infrastrukturprojekte – und könnte durch Importzölle auf ausländische Maschinen Marktanteile gewinnen. Hinweis: Diese Aktien sind spekulativer als die Top 5 – bieten aber unter Trumps politischer Agenda gezielte Chancen, vor allem im Bereich Technologie, Bau und nationale Sicherheit.","https://finment.com/boerse-aktien/us-aktien/top-donald-trump-aktien/"
